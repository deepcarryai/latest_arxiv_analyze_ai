Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review", "abstract": "There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes."}

One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning."}

We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies."}

We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries."}

Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks.

Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance.

To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines.

We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation."}

In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs."}

Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**.

While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems."}

Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation).

Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results."}

Building on this, we propose \\textbf{DAMI} (\\textbf{D}yn\\textbf{A}mic \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $\\lambda(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2."}

Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds.

In this work, we uncover a striking \"Paradox of Robustness\": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be \"brittle\" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably \"stable\" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts.

This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\\underline{LI}ff\\underline{O}rd \\underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs.

This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation.

Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \\textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters."}

Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels.

First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality.

Moderate steering strengths ($\\lambda \\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($\\eta_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($\\eta_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($\\eta_p^2 = 0.042$).

Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation."}

To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies.

This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history.

Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains."}

Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies.

By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \\textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{JADE} (\\textbf{J}oint \\textbf{A}gentic \\textbf{D}ynamic \\textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \\textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration."}

In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \\textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \\textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \\textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment.

DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability.

Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents."}

To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects."}

This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime."}

Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration.

To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions.

The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control.

Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings."}

Therefore, if a delay time occurs when a bearing is diagnosed with a defect, this may cause economic loss and loss of life. Moreover, since the vibration sensor from which the signal is collected is highly affected by the operating environment and surrounding noise, accurate defect diagnosis in a noisy environment is also important. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and strong robustness network (LSR-Net) that is accurate in a noisy environment and enables real-time fault diagnosis. To this end, first, a denoising and feature enhancement module (DFEM) was designed to create a 3-channel 2D matrix by giving several nonlinearity to the feature-map that passed through the denoising module (DM) block composed of convolution-based denoising (CD) blocks. Moreover, adaptive pruning was applied to DM to improve denoising ability when the power of noise is strong. Second, for lightweight model design, a convolution-based efficiency shuffle (CES) block was designed using group convolution (GConv), group pointwise convolution (GPConv) and channel split that can design the model while maintaining low parameters. In addition, the trade-off between the accuracy and model computational complexity that can occur due to the lightweight design of the model was supplemented using attention mechanisms and channel shuffle.

As a result, it was confirmed that the proposed model had the best anti-noise ability compared to the benchmark models, and the computational complexity of the model was also the lowest."}

We observe that conventional prompt tuning for ALMs also suffers from the Base-New Tradeoff, and we identify that this issue stems from the disrupted semantic structure of the embedding space. To address this issue, we propose Semantically Expanded Prompt Tuning (SEPT)-a plug-and-play framework that explicitly regularizes the prompt embedding space by incorporating semantic neighbors generated by large language models. SEPT introduces a novel semantic expansion loss with margin constraints that promote intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, thereby enhancing the semantic structure of the prompt embedding space. For comprehensive evaluation, we establish the first benchmark setup for prompt generalization in ALMs, covering both base-to-new generalization and cross-dataset transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEPT consistently improves generalization performance across multiple prompt tuning baselines, while maintaining computational cost during inference.

To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%."}

Typical colors associated with melanocytic lesions include tan, brown, black, red, white, and blue gray.

We propose a color histogram analysis method to examine lesion pixel values from three publicly available datasets: PH2, ISIC2016, and Med Node. The PH2 dataset contains ground truth annotations of lesion colors, while ISIC2016 and Med Node do not; our algorithm estimates the ground truth using color histogram analysis based on PH2. We then design and train a 19 layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with residual skip connections to classify lesions into three categories based on the number of colors present. DeepDream visualization is used to interpret features learned by the network, and multiple CNN configurations are tested. The best model achieves a weighted F1 score of 75 percent. LIME is applied to identify important regions influencing model decisions. The results show that the number of colors in a lesion is a significant feature for describing skin conditions, and the proposed CNN with three skip connections demonstrates strong potential for clinical diagnostic support."}

However, existing methods suffer from the inefficiency of incremental context construction that requires step-by-step LLM interaction, and often stagnate in suboptimal regions due to surface-level optimization. In this paper, we characterize the Intent-Context Coupling phenomenon, revealing that LLM safety constraints are significantly relaxed when a malicious intent is coupled with a semantically congruent context pattern. Driven by this insight, we propose ICON, an automated multi-turn jailbreak framework that efficiently constructs an authoritative-style context via prior-guided semantic routing. Specifically, ICON first routes the malicious intent to a congruent context pattern (e.g., Scientific Research) and instantiates it into an attack prompt sequence. This sequence progressively builds the authoritative-style context and ultimately elicits prohibited content. In addition, ICON incorporates a Hierarchical Optimization Strategy that combines local prompt refinement with global context switching, preventing the attack from stagnating in ineffective contexts.

Deep learning can accelerate imaging by reconstructing spectra from rapid, single-scan inputs. However, separating noise and baseline drift simultaneously without ground truth is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard black-box architectures often rely on statistical approximations that introduce spectral hallucinations or fail to generalize to unstable atmospheric conditions. To solve these issues we propose a physics-informed cascade Unet that separates denoising and baseline correction tasks using a new, deterministic Physics Bridge. This architecture forces the network to separate random noise from chemical signals using an embedded SNIP layer to enforce spectroscopic constraints instead of learning statistical approximations. We benchmarked this approach against a standard single Unet and a traditional Savitzky-Golay/SNIP workflow. We used a dataset of human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu). The cascade model outperformed all other methods, achieving a 51.3% reduction in RMSE compared to raw single-scan inputs, surpassing both the single Unet (40.2%) and the traditional workflow (33.7%). Peak-aware metrics show that the cascade architecture eliminates spectral hallucinations found in standard deep learning. It also preserves peak intensity with much higher fidelity than traditional smoothing. These results show that the cascade Unet is a robust solution for diagnostic-grade FTIR imaging. It enables imaging speeds 32 times faster than current methods."}

By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset.

Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning.

We first employ permutation-invariant feature hashing to sketch raw inputs into a fixed size state sequence. We then construct a hybrid kernel image to capture global temporal structure through pairwise comparisons of the sequence and its derivatives. The model learns normal patterns using masked reconstruction and a teacher-student prediction objective. Our evaluation reveals that robust log-distance channels provide the primary discriminative signal, whereas cosine representations often fail to capture sufficient contrast.

Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains.

We propose LOCUS, a method that produces low-dimensional vector embeddings that compactly represent a language model's capabilities across queries. LOCUS is an attention-based approach that generates embeddings by a deterministic forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores via an encoder model, enabling seamless incorporation of new models to the pool and refinement of existing model embeddings without having to perform any retraining. We additionally train a correctness predictor that uses model embeddings and query encodings to achieve state-of-the-art routing accuracy on unseen queries. Experiments show that LOCUS needs up to 4.8x fewer query evaluation samples than baselines to produce informative and robust embeddings. Moreover, the learned embedding space is geometrically meaningful: proximity reflects model similarity, enabling a range of downstream applications including model comparison and clustering, model portfolio selection, and resilient proxies of unavailable models."}

Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) networks, with their symmetric 6-regular topology, offer superior topological properties but challenge traditional routing heuristics under fault conditions. This paper evaluates three routing paradigms in faulty EJ environments: deterministic Greedy Adaptive Routing, theoretically optimal Dijkstra's algorithm, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach. Using a multi-objective reward function to penalize fault proximity and reward path efficiency, the RL agent learns to navigate around clustered failures that typically induce dead-ends in greedy geometric routing. Dijkstra's algorithm establishes the theoretical performance ceiling by computing globally optimal paths with complete topology knowledge, revealing the true connectivity limits of faulty networks. Quantitative analysis at nine faulty nodes shows greedy routing catastrophically degrades to 10% effective reachability and packet delivery, while Dijkstra proves 52-54% represents the topological optimum. The RL agent achieves 94% effective reachability and 91% packet delivery, making it suitable for distributed deployment. Furthermore, throughput evaluations demonstrate that RL sustains over 90% normalized throughput across all loads, actually outperforming Dijkstra under congestion through implicit load balancing strategies. These results establish RL-based adaptive policies as a practical solution that bridges the gap between greedy's efficiency and Dijkstra's optimality, providing robust, self-healing communication in fault-prone interconnection networks without requiring the global topology knowledge or computational overhead of optimal algorithms."}

To address this gap, we introduce SteerEval, an evaluation framework designed to measure more nuanced and diverse forms of steerability by using interventions that range from genres to content-warning for movies. We assess the steerability of a family of pretrained natural-language recommenders, examine the potential and limitations of steering on relatively niche topics, and compare how different profile and recommendation interventions impact steering effectiveness.

Our evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks reveals that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scale across model families, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks while maintaining summarization capabilities.

We propose three requirements for responsible AI-assisted engineering: (1) epistemic layers that separate unverified hypotheses from empirically validated claims, (2) conservative assurance aggregation grounded in the Gödel t-norm that prevents weak evidence from inflating confidence, and (3) automated evidence decay tracking that surfaces stale assumptions before they cause failures. We formalize these requirements as the First Principles Framework (FPF), ground its aggregation semantics in fuzzy logic, and define a quintet of invariants that any valid aggregation operator must satisfy. Our retrospective audit applying FPF criteria to two internal projects found that 20-25% of architectural decisions had stale evidence within two months, validating the need for temporal accountability.

Unlike conventional artistic NST, which prioritizes painterly abstraction, stylizing human-altered landscapes demands a careful balance between amplifying material textures and preserving semantic legibility. Industrial infrastructures, waste accumulations, and modified ecosystems contain dense, repetitive patterns that are visually expressive yet highly susceptible to semantic erosion under aggressive style transfer.To address this challenge, we systematically investigate the impact of NST parameter configurations on the visual translation of Anthropocene textures, including feature layer selection, style and content loss weighting, training stability, and output resolution. Through controlled experiments, we identify an optimal parameter manifold that maximizes stylistic expression while preventing semantic erasure. Our results demonstrate that appropriate combinations of convolutional depth, loss ratios, and resolution scaling enable the faithful transformation of anthropogenic material properties into a coherent visual language.Building on these findings, we implement a low-latency, feed-forward NST pipeline deployed on mobile devices. The system integrates a React Native frontend with a Flask-based GPU backend, achieving high-resolution inference within 3-5 seconds on general mobile hardware.

Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines.

An Investigation Into the Group-theoretic Structures Learned By Narrow Models Trained To Predict Group Operations", "abstract": "While a real-world research program in mathematics may be guided by a motivating question, the process of mathematical discovery is typically open-ended. Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects."}

We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset.

We study robust aggregation rules, including median and trimmed mean, and an adaptive trust-weighted consensus that updates evaluator weights from deviation signals. Using question answering and summarization workloads with a ground truth proxy for offline analysis, we quantify evaluator reliability and show strong variance across evaluators, including task-dependent misalignment that can invert correlations. We then evaluate robustness under four adversarial strategies, including noise injection, boosting, sabotage, and intermittent manipulation, across a sweep of malicious ratios and evaluator sample sizes. Our results show that robust aggregation improves consensus alignment with the ground truth proxy and reduces sensitivity to noisy and strategic attacks compared with simple averaging. We further characterize the operational trade-off introduced by evaluator sampling, where larger evaluator sets reduce evaluator rewards and increase payoff variance while inference rewards remain relatively stable in our configuration.

This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling."}

Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency.

In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch.

To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework.

In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes.

Feature engineering creates information bottlenecks through gradient quantization and spatial binning, potentially filtering high-frequency adversarial signals. We evaluate this hypothesis through the first comprehensive study of adversarial transfer from DNNs to HOG-based classifiers. Using VGG16 as a surrogate, we generate FGSM and PGD adversarial examples and test transfer to four classical classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM) and a shallow neural network across eight HOG configurations on CIFAR-10. Our results strongly refute the protective hypothesis: all classifiers suffer 16.6%-59.1% relative accuracy drops, comparable to neural-to-neural transfer. More surprisingly, we discover attack hierarchy reversal--contrary to patterns where iterative PGD dominates FGSM within neural networks, FGSM causes greater degradation than PGD in 100% of classical ML cases, suggesting iterative attacks overfit to surrogate-specific features that don't survive feature extraction.

Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality.

To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree.

To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence.

This decoupling mitigates gradient interference across divergent semantic patterns and addresses explicit weight symmetry requirements through our refined feedback alignment. Empirically, SAL demonstrates competitive convergence rates, leading to improved classification performance across 10 standard benchmarks. Additionally, SAL achieves numerical consistency and competitive accuracy even in deep regimes (up to 128 layers) and large-scale models (up to 1B parameters).

Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers.

Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \\textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM.

We investigate the geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA), the premise that local updates coherently propagate to logical consequences. To formalize this, we adopt relation algebra and study three core operations on relations: negation flips truth values, converse swaps argument order, and composition chains relations. For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear. Since bilinearity is incompatible with negation, this forces the feature map to collapse. These results suggest that failures in knowledge editing, the reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning may stem from common structural limitations inherent to the LPA."}

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner.

This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism. We then propose a lightweight method, T2, to break the overscaling curse, which utilizes latent representations to estimate the optimal parallelism level for each sample before decoding.

To address this, we propose the Hessian Robust Quantization (HeRo Q) algorithm, which applies a lightweight, learnable rotation-compression matrix to the weight space prior to quantization. This joint framework reshapes the loss landscape by reducing the largest Hessian eigenvalue and reducing its max eigenvalue, thereby significantly enhancing robustness to quantization noise.

In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains.

We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability."}

Existing similarity measures such as CKA or SVCCA capture pointwise overlap between activation sets, but miss how representations change along input paths. Two models may appear nearly identical under these metrics yet respond very differently to perturbations or adversarial stress. We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the \"twist\" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii. Empirically, holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. It also tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize. Together, these results position representation holonomy as a practical and scalable diagnostic for probing the geometric structure of learned representations beyond pointwise similarity."}

We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables.

Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization."}

To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems."}

The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model."}

Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios.

We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\\% more samples than PIDM."}

For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|\\Delta$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets.

In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations.

Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality.

We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set.

Current defenses predominantly rely on the \"locality hypothesis\", suppressing isolated neurons or features.

To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility.

We present a year-long study on the longitudinal use of AI in a high-stakes workplace among cancer specialists. Initial operational gains hid ``intuition rust'': the gradual dulling of expert judgment. These asymptomatic effects evolved into chronic harms, such as skill atrophy and identity commoditization. Building on these findings, we offer a framework for dignified Human-AI interaction co-constructed with professional knowledge workers facing AI-induced skill erosion without traditional labor protections. The framework operationalizes sociotechnical immunity through dual-purpose mechanisms that serve institutional quality goals while building worker power to detect, contain, and recover from skill erosion, and preserve human identity.

Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions.

SymbXRL leverages symbolic AI to produce explanations where key concepts and their relationships are described via intuitive symbols and rules; coupling such a representation with logical reasoning exposes the decision process of DRL agents and offers more comprehensible descriptions of their behaviors compared to existing approaches. We validate SymbXRL in practical network management use cases supported by DRL, proving that it not only improves the semantics of the explanations but also paves the way for explicit agent control: for instance, it enables intent-based programmatic action steering that improves by 12% the median cumulative reward over a pure DRL solution."}

Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs), which iteratively refine all tokens in parallel, offer a way to decouple computation order from output structure. We validate this capability on GSM8K, Math500, and ReasonOrderQA, a benchmark we introduce with controlled difficulty and order-level evaluation. When prompts request answers before reasoning, AR models exhibit large accuracy gaps compared to standard chain-of-thought ordering (up to 67% relative drop), while MDLMs remain stable ($\\leq$14% relative drop), a property we term \"order robustness\".

Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty.

This is especially salient for human-centred perception tasks, such as human activity recognition and affect prediction, where inferences about behaviour and internal states can lead to errors or stereotypical associations that propagate into unequal treatment. In this work, focusing on human activity and affective expression, we study how such associations evolve within an inter-model communication pipeline that alternates between image generation and image description. Using the RAF-DB and PHASE datasets, we quantify demographic distribution drift induced by model-to-model information exchange and assess whether these drifts are systematic using an explainability pipeline. Our results reveal demographic drifts toward younger representations for both actions and emotions, as well as toward more female-presenting representations, primarily for emotions. We further find evidence that some predictions are supported by spurious visual regions (e.g., background or hair) rather than concept-relevant cues (e.g., body or face). We also examine whether these demographic drifts translate into measurable differences in downstream behaviour, i.e., while predicting activity and emotion labels. Finally, we outline mitigation strategies spanning data-centric, training and deployment interventions, and emphasise the need for careful safeguards when deploying interconnected models in human-centred AI systems."}

However, existing approaches still rely on accumulating their updates in high-precision: concretely, gradient updates must be applied to a high-precision weight buffer, known as $\\textit{master weights}$. This buffer introduces substantial memory overhead, particularly for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, where model parameters and optimizer states dominate memory usage. To address this, we introduce the Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO), which eliminates master weights by applying updates directly to quantized parameters. ECO quantizes weights after each step and carefully injects the resulting quantization error into the optimizer momentum, forming an error-feedback loop with no additional memory. We prove that, under standard assumptions and a decaying learning rate, ECO converges to a constant-radius neighborhood of the optimum, while naive master-weight removal can incur an error that is inversely proportional to the learning rate. We show empirical results for pretraining small Transformers (30-800M), a Gemma-3 1B model, and a 2.1B parameter Sparse MoE model with FP8 quantization, and fine-tuning DeepSeek-MoE-16B in INT4 precision.

The V-Pretraining task designer selects pretraining tasks (e.g., augmentations) for which the pretraining loss gradient is aligned with a gradient computed over a downstream task (e.g., image segmentation).

In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates.

StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate.

However, recent studies indicate that the collapse of cooperation may emerge in multi-agent systems (MASs) driven by large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we explore reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic, dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for future interactions. Through three distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet effectively avoids cooperation collapse, promoting and sustaining cooperation in LLM-based MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can give rise to rich emergent behaviors in LLM-based MASs, such as the formation of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.

Existing agent frameworks typically treat tools as ordinary actions and optimize for task success or reward, offering little principled distinction between epistemically necessary interaction and unnecessary delegation. This position paper argues that agents should invoke external tools only when epistemically necessary. Here, epistemic necessity means that a task cannot be completed reliably via the agent's internal reasoning over its current context, without any external interaction. We introduce the Theory of Agent (ToA), a framework that treats agents as making sequential decisions about whether remaining uncertainty should be resolved internally or delegated externally. From this perspective, common agent failure modes (e.g., overthinking and overacting) arise from miscalibrated decisions under uncertainty rather than deficiencies in reasoning or tool execution alone. We further discuss implications for training, evaluation, and agent design, highlighting that unnecessary delegation not only causes inefficiency but can impede the development of internal reasoning capability. Our position provides a normative criterion for tool use that complements existing decision-theoretic models and is essential for building agents that are not only correct, but increasingly intelligent."}

Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace."}

To study this threat systematically, we propose SafeSearch, an automated red-teaming framework that is scalable, cost-efficient, and lightweight, enabling harmless safety evaluation of search agents. Using this, we generate 300 test cases spanning five risk categories (e.g., misinformation and prompt injection) and evaluate three search agent scaffolds across 17 representative LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities in LLM-based search agents, with the highest ASR reaching 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini in a search-workflow setting.

Multidimensional scaling configurations show alignment with pooled human data from 49 different countries. Generalizability tests across three personality inventories (IPIP, BFI-2, HEXACO) demonstrate that SQuID consistently increases correlation ranges, suggesting applicability beyond value theory.

Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair (PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches, requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies."}

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature.

Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies."}

To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances.

By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state.

We argue that the key mechanism for continual adaptation, without updating model parameters, is reflection: the agent's ability to use past experience to guide future actions. Empirical findings suggest that episodic, experience-driven reflection enables generalised adaptation across a wide range of open-ended, long-horizon tasks. This indicates that efficient learning can occur during deployment and weakens the traditional separation between training and testing. Motivated by this, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, a formal model of reflective memory dynamics. In this abstraction, an agent maintains an episodic memory and performs two core operations. Writing stores interaction outcomes and plays the role of policy evaluation. Reading retrieves relevant past cases to inform decisions and plays the role of policy improvement. This perspective treats reflective memory as a control object that can be analysed using classical reinforcement learning tools. We then develop a read-write reflective learning framework by integrating retrieval into soft policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. We show that as memory grows and provides denser coverage of the state space, the resulting composite policy converges to the optimal solution. Overall, this framework connects practical memory-based methods with principled reinforcement learning, providing a rigorous mathematical basis for building reflective, memory-embedded agents capable of continual general-purpose learning."}

This highlights a critical gap: little systematic exploration has been conducted on how comprehensive, high-quality GKGs can be effectively leveraged to supplement DKGs.To address this gap, we propose a new and practical task: domain-specific knowledge graph fusion (DKGF), which aims to mine and integrate relevant facts from general knowledge graphs into domain-specific knowledge graphs to enhance their completeness and utility.

These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1."}

We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time.

While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making."}

This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning.

Drawing inspiration from the brain's contextual gating mechanism, which selectively filters neural information and continuously updates past memories, we propose Low-redundancy Distillation (LoRD), a novel CL method that enhances model performance while maintaining training efficiency. This is achieved by eliminating redundancy in three aspects of CL: student model redundancy, teacher model redundancy, and rehearsal sample redundancy. By compressing the learnable parameters of the student model and pruning the teacher model, LoRD facilitates the retention and optimization of prior knowledge, effectively decoupling task-specific knowledge without manually assigning isolated parameters for each task. Furthermore, we optimize the selection of rehearsal samples and refine rehearsal frequency to improve training efficiency. Through a meticulous design of distillation and rehearsal strategies, LoRD effectively balances training efficiency and model precision. Extensive experimentation across various benchmark datasets and environments demonstrates LoRD's superiority, achieving the highest accuracy with the lowest training FLOPs."}

While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics."}

The subtle phenotypical and physiological changes in response to drought stress are captured by non-invasive imaging techniques and these imaging data serve as valuable resource for machine learning methods to identify drought stress. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are in wide use, vision transformers (ViTs) present a promising alternative in capturing long-range dependencies and intricate spatial relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle indicators of drought stress. We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress. Our key findings explain the ViT model's decision-making process by visualizing attention maps. These maps highlight the specific spatial features within the aerial images that the ViT model focuses as the drought stress signature. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed methods not only achieve high accuracy in drought stress identification but also shedding light on the diverse subtle plant features associated with drought stress.

While several methods tackle multi-hop queries by iteratively generating internal queries and retrieving external documents, these approaches are computationally expensive.

This observation suggests that the representations in intermediate layers contain richer information compared to those in other layers. Building on this insight, we propose Layer-wise RAG (L-RAG). Unlike prior methods that focus on generating new internal queries, L-RAG leverages intermediate representations from the middle layers, which capture next-hop information, to retrieve external knowledge. L-RAG achieves performance comparable to multi-step approaches while maintaining inference overhead similar to that of standard RAG.

The performance of GPU programs depends on how data is parallelized across threads and arranged within memory subsystems. The mapping functions describing tensors on GPUs are known as \\emph{tensor layouts}. Low-level programming frameworks, such as CUTLASS and Hidet, provide expressive layout abstractions but often require \\emph{considerable programming effort} to manually specify optimal layouts. High-level GPU programming languages, such as Triton, rely on compiler heuristics to generate dataflow, layouts, and pipelining strategies in GPU programs. However, the heuristics for dataflow and pipelining strategies are not generalizable to complex operators. To balance expressiveness and programmability, we propose Hexcute, a compiler framework that automates layout synthesis while providing explicit control over dataflow and pipelining. Hexcute formalizes layout synthesis as a constraint programming problem and solves it with a type-inference-based algorithm. This approach enables systematic exploration of optimal layouts and instructions.Our evaluation shows that Hexcute matches the performance of libraries like cuBLAS and FlashAttention on GEMM, Attention, and their variants, while reducing the amount of code by 1.27$\\times$-7.94$\\times$ compared to CUTLASS. For mixed-type mixture-of-experts (MoE) operators, Hexcute achieves an average speedup of 6.46$\\times$ over Triton.

Following the original formulation, most advancements focus on designing better parameterizations for the kernel over the original physical domain (with $d$ spatial dimensions, $d\\in{1,2,3,\\ldots}$). In contrast, embedding evolution remains largely unexplored, which often drives models toward brute-force embedding lengthening to improve approximation, but at the cost of substantially increased computation.In this paper, we introduce an auxiliary dimension that explicitly models embedding evolution in operator form, thereby redefining the NO framework in $d+1$ dimensions (the original $d$ dimensions plus one auxiliary dimension). Under this formulation, we develop a Schrödingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO), which leverages Fourier-based operators to model the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. Across more than ten increasingly challenging benchmarks, ranging from the 1D heat equation to the highly nonlinear 3D Rayleigh-Taylor instability, SKNO consistently outperforms other baselines.

As a consequence, cloud-based services that provide access to large language models have become very popular. In these services, the price users pay for an output provided by a model depends on the number of tokens the model uses to generate it: they pay a fixed price per token. In this work, we show that this pricing mechanism creates a financial incentive for providers to strategize and misreport the (number of) tokens a model used to generate an output, and users cannot prove, or even know, whether a provider is overcharging them. However, we also show that, if an unfaithful provider is obliged to be transparent about the generative process used by the model, misreporting optimally without raising suspicion is hard. Nevertheless, as a proof-of-concept, we develop an efficient heuristic algorithm that allows providers to significantly overcharge users without raising suspicion. Crucially, we demonstrate that the cost of running the algorithm is lower than the additional revenue from overcharging users, highlighting the vulnerability of users under the current pay-per-token pricing mechanism. Further, we show that, to eliminate the financial incentive to strategize, a pricing mechanism must price tokens linearly on their character count. While this makes a provider's profit margin vary across tokens, we introduce a simple prescription under which the provider who adopts such an incentive-compatible pricing mechanism can maintain the average profit margin they had under the pay-per-token pricing mechanism.

However, the complex mechanisms that link neuron's functional co-activation with the emergent model capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity of LLM neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By probing models across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of language generation and understanding performance using only neural topology, which persists even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections. Strikingly, probing on topology outperforms probing on activation by up to 130.4% and 67.7% on perplexity and space/time semantic regression respectively, suggesting that neural topology contains orders of richer information of LLM performance than neural activation, which can be easily extracted with simple linear or MLP probes. To explain the dependence between neural topology and language performance, we identify default networks and hub neurons in LLMs and provide causal evidence by interventional experiments on multiple benchmarks, showing that LLMs actually exploit these topological information. Further analyses suggest that graph probing can be effectively leveraged to improve the efficiency and reliability of LLMs through proof-of-concept applications in model pruning and hallucination detection.

This paper studies learning from noisy partial labels generated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes a collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) framework. Unlike symmetric noise commonly assumed in traditional noisy label learning, VLM-generated noise is instance-dependent and reflects the intrinsic biases of pre-trained models, posing greater challenges. To address this issue, we jointly train two neural networks to perform collaborative label purification via a co-pseudo-labeling mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization in both label and feature representation spaces. In addition, multiple anti-overfitting strategies are introduced, including alternating optimization of contrastive representations and pseudo-labels, as well as maintaining class prototypes in a shared feature space.

These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods."}

Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Grouped-Query Attention are memory-bound due to low arithmetic intensity, while FeedForward Networks are compute-bound. This dichotomy has long motivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the attention bottleneck.This paper argues that recent architectural advances in transformer models -- Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) -- introduce new dominant bottlenecks, shifting the challenge away from memory-intensive attention. We make two key observations. First, the arithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude higher than that of MHA, moving it toward a compute-bound regime well-matched to modern accelerators such as GPUs. Second, distributing MoE experts across a pool of accelerators allows batching to tune their arithmetic intensity to that of dense layers, producing a more balanced computational profile. Consequently, the focus of hardware and system optimization should shift from attention acceleration to high-bandwidth interconnects and balancing expert workloads across accelerators."}

Although this architecture has attained substantial success, the coupling between representation and value learning creates instability as representations must constantly adapt to non-stationary value targets, while value estimates depend on these shifting representations. This is compounded by high variance in bootstrapped targets, which causes bias in value estimation in off-policy methods. We introduce Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER), a framework for value-based RL that views representation and Q-learning as two strategic agents in a hierarchical game. SCORER models the Q-function as the leader, which commits to its strategy by updating less frequently, while the perception network (encoder) acts as the follower, adapting more frequently to learn representations that minimize Bellman error variance given the leader's committed strategy. Through this division of labor, the Q-function minimizes MSBE while perception minimizes its variance, thereby reducing bias accordingly, with asymmetric updates allowing stable co-adaptation, unlike simultaneous parameter updates in monolithic solutions. Our proposed SCORER framework leads to a bi-level optimization problem whose solution is approximated by a two-timescale algorithm that creates an asymmetric learning dynamic between the two players. Extensive experiments on DQN and its variants demonstrate that gains stem from algorithmic insight rather than model complexity."}

We present a new, manually-annotated multi-domain dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across ten U.S. cities.

Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme. Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression. Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme both theoretically and numerically.

Our analysis reveals two unexpected and robust structural changes: (1) a near-uniform geometric scaling of singular values across layers; and (2) highly consistent orthogonal transformations are applied to the left and right singular vectors of each matrix.

In this paper, we propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set, yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that, unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods."}

Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries.

We propose a novel Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder (EntroPE), as a temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. Extensive experiments on long-term forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection demonstrate that the proposed method improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series modeling.

To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Target Attack (DTA), which leverages the target LLM's own responses as adaptive targets. In each optimization round, DTA samples multiple candidates from the output distribution conditioned on the current prompt, and selects the most harmful one as a temporary target for prompt optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the white-box setting, DTA achieves over 87% average attack success rate (ASR) within 200 optimization iterations on recent safety-aligned LLMs, exceeding the state-of-the-art baselines by over 15% and reducing wall-clock time by 2-26x.

For tractable optimization, we further decompose this objective into two differentiable sub-objectives to search the optimal harmful response and the corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate the decomposition. In contrast to existing attacks, UJA's unrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling more flexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.

We introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported bugs, removing bugs and patches rejected by our policies can raise success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination.

When candidate diversity is curtailed, even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv) that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through extensive experiments across open-source models (e.g. Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1, Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact.

Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions. We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker. Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential sweet spot between classical and quantum computation, where trained QRL policies could still be modeled classically for probabilistic model checking.

Yet, despite remarkable cross-disciplinary efforts, a principled account of how task structure shapes gating and how such computations could be delivered in neural circuits, remains elusive. Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability."}

Recent works in mechanistic interpretability have widely reported that neural networks represent meaningful concepts as linear directions in their representation spaces and often encode diverse concepts in superposition. Various sparse dictionary learning (SDL) methods, including sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders, are utilized to address this by training auxiliary models with sparsity constraints to disentangle these superposed concepts into monosemantic features. These methods are the backbone of modern mechanistic interpretability, yet in practice they consistently produce polysemantic features, feature absorption, and dead neurons, with very limited theoretical understanding of why these phenomena occur. Existing theoretical work is limited to tied-weight sparse autoencoders, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. We develop the first unified theoretical framework that casts all major SDL variants as a single piecewise biconvex optimization problem, and characterize its global solution set, non-identifiability, and spurious optima. This analysis yields principled explanations for feature absorption and dead neurons. To expose these pathologies under full ground-truth access, we introduce the Linear Representation Bench. Guided by our theory, we propose feature anchoring, a novel technique that restores SDL identifiability, substantially improving feature recovery across synthetic benchmarks and real neural representations."}

Instead of enforcing a fixed taxonomy or single clustering resolution, the method progressively relaxes local density constraints, revealing how compact semantic groups merge into broader thematic regions. The resulting tree encodes multi-scale semantic organization directly from data, making structural relationships between topics explicit. We evaluate the hierarchies on standard text benchmarks, showing that semantic alignment peaks at intermediate density levels and that abrupt transitions correspond to meaningful changes in semantic resolution. Beyond benchmarks, the approach is applied to large institutional and scientific corpora, exposing dominant fields, cross-disciplinary proximities, and emerging thematic clusters. By framing hierarchical structure as an emergent property of density in embedding spaces, this method provides an interpretable, multi-scale representation of semantic structure suitable for large, evolving text collections."}

To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy.

However, what is deemed \"aesthetic\" is inextricably linked to personal taste and cultural values, raising the question of whose taste is represented in visual generative AI models. In this work, we study an aesthetic evaluation model--LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP)--that is widely used to curate datasets to train visual generative image models, like Stable Diffusion, and evaluate the quality of AI-generated images. To understand what LAP measures, we audited the model across three datasets. First, we examined the impact of aesthetic filtering on the LAION-Aesthetics Dataset (approximately 1.2B images), which was curated from LAION-5B using LAP. We find that the LAP disproportionally filters in images with captions mentioning women, while filtering out images with captions mentioning men or LGBTQ+ people. Then, we used LAP to score approximately 330k images across two art datasets, finding the model rates realistic images of landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits from western and Japanese artists most highly. In doing so, the algorithmic gaze of this aesthetic evaluation model reinforces the imperial and male gazes found within western art history. In order to understand where these biases may have originated, we performed a digital ethnography of public materials related to the creation of LAP. We find that the development of LAP reflects the biases we found in our audits, such as the aesthetic scores used to train LAP primarily coming from English-speaking photographers and western AI-enthusiasts. In response, we discuss how aesthetic evaluation can perpetuate representational harms and call on AI developers to shift away from prescriptive measures of \"aesthetics\" toward more pluralistic evaluation."}

Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency."}

However, practical deployments often exhibit rank and data heterogeneity: clients operate under different low-rank budgets and data distributions, making direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing approaches either enforce a unified rank or align heterogeneous updates into a single shared subspace, which tends to mix transferable and client-specific directions and consequently undermines personalization. Moreover, under differential privacy (DP), perturbing such structurally mixed updates injects noise into directions that should remain purely local, leading to unnecessary utility degradation. To address these issues, we propose Selective Decoupled Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), a structure-aware LoRA framework that decouples each client update into a shared component for aggregation and a private component that preserves client-specific semantics. Only the shared component participates in subspace alignment, while the private component remains local and uncommunicated, making the training DP-compatible and stabilizing aggregation under rank heterogeneity. By injecting noise only into the aggregated shareable update, this approach avoids perturbations to local directions and improves the utility-privacy trade-off. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms federated LoRA baselines and achieves a strong utility-privacy trade-off."}

We address this by analyzing the policy gradient dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, policy gradient drives the Transformer to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of \"simple examples\": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler examples, the Transformer learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, policy gradient learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings."}

While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments."}

Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025.

In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale."}

For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems."}

Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance.

In this work, we propose Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL), a computationally efficient yet effective method that generates perturbations using only linear surrogate models.

However, the advent of large-scale recommenders also brings significantly higher computational costs, particularly under the long-sequence dependencies inherent in the user intent of recommendation systems. Current approaches often rely on pre-storing the intermediate states of the past behavior for each user, thereby reducing the quadratic re-computation cost for the following requests. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often treat memory merely as a medium for acceleration, without adequately considering the space overhead it introduces. This presents a critical challenge in real-world recommendation systems with billions of users, each of whom might initiate thousands of interactions and require massive memory for state storage. Fortunately, there have been several memory management strategies examined for compression in LLM, while most have not been evaluated on the recommendation task.

This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites."}

This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space.

We present a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework that integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment. The framework yields three metrics: phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and a newly proposed alignment-free measure, phoneme coverage (PhonCov). Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that PER benefits from the combination of mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment alone, and PhonCov from mapping. Further analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework captures clinically meaningful patterns of intelligibility degradation consistent with established observations of dysarthric speech."}

However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across different tasks and LLMs show that it consistently improves reasoning hop generalization, highlighting both its effectiveness and potential."}

As a result, they can generate factually incorrect responses on topics they do not have enough knowledge of, commonly known as hallucination. Rather than hallucinating, a language model should be more honest and respond with \"I don't know\" when it does not have enough knowledge about a topic. Many methods have been proposed to improve LLM honesty, but their evaluations lack robustness, as they do not take into account the knowledge that the LLM has ingested during its pretraining. In this paper, we propose a more robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty by utilizing Pythia, a truly open LLM with publicly available pretraining data.

However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling."}

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality."}

We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread \"False Certification\" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a \"Trojan\" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance.

To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification.

If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation and enabling joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play, without external judges or ground truth. Experiments on five benchmarks show that CoNL achieves consistent improvements over self-rewarding baselines while maintaining stable training."}

State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods."}

Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pretraining on L1 languages with varying syntactic distance from the L2. Using cross-linguistic priming, we analyze how activating L1 structures impacts L2 processing.

We further find that while priming of grammatical structures is bidirectional, the priming of ungrammatical structures is sensitive to language dominance. Finally, we provide mechanistic evidence of CLI in LMs, demonstrating that the L1 is co-activated during L2 processing and directly influences the neural circuitry recruited for the L2. More broadly, our work demonstrates that LMs can serve as a computational framework to inform theories of human CLI."}

We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data.

At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs.

Therefore, memory systems are developed to leverage essential historical information. Existing memory systems typically follow a pipeline of offline memory construction and update, and online retrieval. Despite the flexible online phase, the offline phase remains fixed and task-independent. In this phase, memory construction operates under a predefined workflow and fails to emphasize task relevant information. Meanwhile, memory updates are guided by generic metrics rather than task specific supervision. This leads to a misalignment between offline memory preparation and task requirements, which undermines downstream task performance. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Memory Adaptation mechanism (AMA) that aligns memory construction and update with task objectives by simulating task execution. Specifically, first, a challenger agent generates question answer pairs based on the original dialogues. The constructed memory is then used to answer these questions, simulating downstream inference. Subsequently, an evaluator agent assesses the responses and performs error analysis. Finally, an adapter agent analyzes the error cases and performs dual level updates on both the construction strategy and the content. Through this process, the memory system receives task aware supervision signals in advance during the offline phase, enhancing its adaptability to downstream tasks.

We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation.

Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios.

However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models.This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language.The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text.

A common design choice in these architectures is the use of a fixed, manually defined prompt during both training and inference. This setup not only enables applicability across a range of practical scenarios, but also helps maximize model performance. However, the impact of prompt design remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of commonly used prompts across diverse datasets, showing that prompt choice significantly affects ASR performance and introduces instability, with no single prompt performing best across all cases. Inspired by the speech-to-LLM projector, we propose a prompt projector module, a simple, model-agnostic extension that learns to project prompt embeddings to more effective regions of the LLM input space, without modifying the underlying LLM-based ASR model. Experiments on four datasets show that the addition of a prompt projector consistently improves performance, reduces variability, and outperforms the best manually selected prompts."}

In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning."}

In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations.

While existing steerability evaluations have shown some success for well-recognized item attributes (e.g., movie genres), we argue that these benchmarks fail to capture the richer forms of user control that motivate steerable recommendations. To address this gap, we introduce SteerEval, an evaluation framework designed to measure more nuanced and diverse forms of steerability by using interventions that range from genres to content-warning for movies. We assess the steerability of a family of pretrained natural-language recommenders, examine the potential and limitations of steering on relatively niche topics, and compare how different profile and recommendation interventions impact steering effectiveness.

The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework.

To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports.

Refined notions of non-uniform and uniform generation were later introduced by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2025), and a noisy model was introduced by Raman and Raman (2025), which allows the adversary to insert extraneous strings. A natural question in the noisy model is to quantify the effect of noise, by studying the impact of each additional extraneous string. We show two complementary results in this setting. We first show that for both uniform and non-uniform generation, a single noisy string strictly reduces the set of collections that can be generated, thus answering an open question in Raman and Raman (2025). Then, we show for both uniform and non-uniform generation that generation with a single noisy string is equivalent to generation with any finite amount of noise, sharply contrasting with the strict hierarchy for noisy generation in the limit shown by Bai, Panigrahi, and Zhang (2026).

The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all.

In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters.

Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus.

There are many ways to enhance software without changing its functionality, considering the extract method refactoring the primary process to reduce the effort required for code comprehension. The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods. We propose a multi-objective integer linear programming model to obtain a set of solutions that reduce the cognitive complexity of a given piece of code, such as balancing the number of lines of code and its cognitive complexity. In addition, several algorithms have been developed to validate the model. These algorithms have been integrated into a tool that enables the parameterised resolution of the problem of reducing software cognitive complexity."}

Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers. We also demonstrate that filtering can be robust to noisy labels with sufficient pretraining compute."}

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner. For distillation, we introduce Latent Reasoning Knowledge Distillation (LRKD), which endows a student model with a lightweight inference-time latent reasoning extractor, allowing efficient and low-latency internalization of the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent.

We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks.

Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability).

This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers.

The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting.

While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability.

However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to \"process hallucinations\", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

Existing work has primarily focused on studying scaling laws for pretraining (upstream) loss. However, in transfer learning settings, in which LLMs are pretrained on an unsupervised dataset and then finetuned on a downstream task, we often also care about the downstream performance. In this work, we study the scaling behavior in a transfer learning setting, where LLMs are finetuned for machine translation tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the choice of the pretraining data and its size affect downstream performance (translation quality) as judged by: downstream cross-entropy and translation quality metrics such as BLEU and COMET scores. Our experiments indicate that the size of the finetuning dataset and the distribution alignment between the pretraining and downstream data significantly influence the scaling behavior. With sufficient alignment, both downstream cross-entropy and translation quality scores improve monotonically with more pretraining data. In such cases, we show that it is possible to predict the downstream translation quality metrics with good accuracy using a log-law. However, there are cases where moderate misalignment causes the downstream translation scores to fluctuate or get worse with more pretraining, whereas downstream cross-entropy monotonically improves. By analyzing these, we provide new practical insights for choosing appropriate pretraining data."}

Nevertheless, the automatic evaluation of such summaries remains underexplored. The current evaluation metrics for long-form summarization either use similarity-based metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore or LLM-based metrics using appropriate prompts or pre-defined schema. We argue that the former only relies on similarity and fails to consider informativeness while the latter lacks quantitative analysis of informative richness, and is rather subjective and hard to explain. Current evaluation metrics either use traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore, which rely on surface-level similarity and fail to consider informativeness, or simple LLM-based metrics, which are not robust and easily overwhelmed by the long contexts. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metric called EVA-Score to extract all information from the given summaries, identify overlapped information based on reference, and calculate the information score. We test EVA-Score on several datasets and the experimental results reveal that EVA-Score shows the highest correlation with humans. We also re-evaluate the performance of LLMs on long-form summarization from the information perspective. The results indicate that responses of LLMs still have a gap with the human-written answers.

By probing models across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of language generation and understanding performance using only neural topology, which persists even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections. Strikingly, probing on topology outperforms probing on activation by up to 130.4% and 67.7% on perplexity and space/time semantic regression respectively, suggesting that neural topology contains orders of richer information of LLM performance than neural activation, which can be easily extracted with simple linear or MLP probes. To explain the dependence between neural topology and language performance, we identify default networks and hub neurons in LLMs and provide causal evidence by interventional experiments on multiple benchmarks, showing that LLMs actually exploit these topological information.

Finally, we distill our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i) using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy."}

However, ICL is inefficient when handling many demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility. Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter parameters with a compositional structure that allows them to be merged algebraically. This approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost, improved stability under long contexts, and establishes a principled solution when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs reversibly encodes information into adapter parameters, enabling recovery of the original input context and facilitating safety. Empirical results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment."}

Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free method to identify and manipulate these dimensions, requiring only as few as 50 sentences of either parallel or monolingual data. Experiments on a multilingual generation control task reveal the interpretability of these dimensions, demonstrating that the interventions in these dimensions can switch the output language while preserving semantic content, and that it surpasses the performance of prior neuron-based approaches at a substantially lower cost."}

When candidate diversity is curtailed, even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv) that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through extensive experiments across open-source models (e.g. Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1, Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited protection against this diversity-driven failure mode."}

Meanwhile, trainable sparse attention is incompatible with efficient offloading, as unconstrained KV accesses may force large CPU-to-GPU transfers and erase throughput gains. To this end, we propose NOSA, a trainable sparse attention mechanism natively designed for KV cache offloading. NOSA explicitly constrains the volume of CPU-GPU KV transfers, thereby achieving low communication overhead and high decoding throughput. We further build NOSI, a KV cache offloading inference system that fully unlocks NOSA's efficiency.

Second, they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided reinforcement learning.

We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses.

While LLMs are known to generate samples that approximate real-world distributions, whether their fine-grained sampling probabilities faithfully align with task requirements remains an open question. Through controlled distribution-sampling simulations, we uncover a striking dichotomy in LLM behavior, distinguishing two model types: D-models (e.g. Qwen-2.5), whose P_token exhibits large step-to-step variability and poor alignment with P_task; and E-models (e.g. Mistral-Small), whose P_token is more stable and better aligned with P_task.

Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems."}

Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink."}

This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows.

However, we observe two types of redundancy in NVFP4 encoding: (1) The FP4 element format naturally exposes an unused quantization value due to its sign-magnitude representation that contains both positive and negative zeros. (2) The FP8 block scaling factor has an unused sign bit because it is always positive. Additionally, we find that LLM weights are more tolerant to a lower-precision block scaling factor. Based on these observations, we propose Redundant Zero Remapping (RaZeR), an enhanced numerical format that pushes the limits of NVFP4 for more accurate LLM quantization under the same memory footprint. RaZeR leverages the redundant bits of the block scaling factor to adaptively remap the redundant FP4 zero to additional quantization values with improved accuracy. To demonstrate the practicality of RaZeR, we design efficient GPU kernels for RaZeR-quantized LLM inference and propose novel hardware to natively support this. Extensive experiments validate RaZeR's superior performance for 4-bit LLM quantization. For example, relative to native NVFP4, RaZeR reduces the average perplexity loss by 34.6% and 31.2% under weight-only and weight-activation quantization, respectively."}

Torr,Mark Coates", "title": "Plain Transformers Can be Powerful Graph Learners", "abstract": "Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, owing to their simple but powerful scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers (GTs) have strayed far from plain Transformers, exhibiting major architectural differences either by integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These divergences hinder the easy adoption of training advances for Transformers developed in other domains. Contrary to previous GTs, this work demonstrates that the plain Transformer architecture can be a powerful graph learner. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate three simple, minimal, and easy-to-implement modifications to the plain Transformer architecture to construct our Powerful Plain Graph Transformers (PPGT): (1) simplified $L_2$ attention for measuring the magnitude closeness among tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a simple MLP-based stem for graph positional encoding. Consistent with its theoretical expressivity, PPGT demonstrates noteworthy realized expressivity on the empirical graph expressivity benchmark, comparing favorably to more complicated alternatives such as subgraph GNNs and higher-order GNNs. Its empirical performance across various graph datasets also justifies the effectiveness of PPGT. This finding underscores the versatility of plain Transformer architectures and highlights their strong potential as a unified backbone for multimodal learning across language, vision, and graph domains."}

GPS first ranks words using importance heuristics, then measures embedding sensitivity to masking top-k critical words, and processes the resulting patterns with a BiLSTM detector. Experiments show that adversarially perturbed words exhibit disproportionately high masking sensitivity compared to naturally important words.

Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MASOrchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented subagents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and subagents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA, while achieving more than 10x efficiency over strong baselines. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence."}

ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution.

However, due to the subtle nature of articulatory gestures, existing lipreading methods often suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper delves into the purification of visual features from temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. We propose a novel method named Multi-Attention Lipreading Network(MA-LipNet). The core of MA-LipNet lies in its sequential application of three dedicated attention modules. Firstly, a \\textit{Channel Attention (CA)} module is employed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise features, thereby mitigating interference from less informative channels. Subsequently, two spatio-temporal attention modules with distinct granularities-\\textit{Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA)} and \\textit{Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA)}-are leveraged to suppress the influence of irrelevant pixels and video frames. The JSTA module performs a coarse-grained filtering by computing a unified weight map across the spatio-temporal dimensions, while the SSTA module conducts a more fine-grained refinement by separately modeling temporal and spatial attentions. Extensive experiments conducted on the CMLR and GRID datasets demonstrate that MA-LipNet significantly reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), validating its effectiveness and superiority over several state-of-the-art methods.

Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry.

Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\\times$ in full-corpus retrieval."}

The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images."}

We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning."}

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion.

Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time.

This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(\\tau > 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($\\rho = 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots."}

Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines.

Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance."}

To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \\textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs.

We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models."}

In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID.

Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm."}

Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a \"less is more\" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset.

Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling."}

Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale.

This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time.

To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$).

Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation."}

Probing Visual Perception vs. Memory with Classic Visual Illusions", "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions \"correctly\" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits.

Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1.

Deep learning can accelerate imaging by reconstructing spectra from rapid, single-scan inputs. However, separating noise and baseline drift simultaneously without ground truth is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard black-box architectures often rely on statistical approximations that introduce spectral hallucinations or fail to generalize to unstable atmospheric conditions. To solve these issues we propose a physics-informed cascade Unet that separates denoising and baseline correction tasks using a new, deterministic Physics Bridge. This architecture forces the network to separate random noise from chemical signals using an embedded SNIP layer to enforce spectroscopic constraints instead of learning statistical approximations. We benchmarked this approach against a standard single Unet and a traditional Savitzky-Golay/SNIP workflow. We used a dataset of human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu). The cascade model outperformed all other methods, achieving a 51.3% reduction in RMSE compared to raw single-scan inputs, surpassing both the single Unet (40.2%) and the traditional workflow (33.7%). Peak-aware metrics show that the cascade architecture eliminates spectral hallucinations found in standard deep learning. It also preserves peak intensity with much higher fidelity than traditional smoothing. These results show that the cascade Unet is a robust solution for diagnostic-grade FTIR imaging. It enables imaging speeds 32 times faster than current methods."}

By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset.

We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns.

Specifically, we first utilize a watermarked image as an anchor and exactly trace the path back to its trajectory origin, effectively locking the model fingerprint mapped by this path. Subsequently, we implement a joint optimization strategy that employs dual-end anchoring to synthesize a specific fingerprint noise, which strictly adheres to the target manifold for robust watermark recovery. As input, it enables the protected target model to recover the watermarked image, while failing on non-target models.

While adversarial transfer within neural networks is well-documented, whether classical ML pipelines using handcrafted features inherit this vulnerability when attacked via neural surrogates remains unexplored. Feature engineering creates information bottlenecks through gradient quantization and spatial binning, potentially filtering high-frequency adversarial signals. We evaluate this hypothesis through the first comprehensive study of adversarial transfer from DNNs to HOG-based classifiers. Using VGG16 as a surrogate, we generate FGSM and PGD adversarial examples and test transfer to four classical classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM) and a shallow neural network across eight HOG configurations on CIFAR-10. Our results strongly refute the protective hypothesis: all classifiers suffer 16.6%-59.1% relative accuracy drops, comparable to neural-to-neural transfer. More surprisingly, we discover attack hierarchy reversal--contrary to patterns where iterative PGD dominates FGSM within neural networks, FGSM causes greater degradation than PGD in 100% of classical ML cases, suggesting iterative attacks overfit to surrogate-specific features that don't survive feature extraction. Block normalization provides partial but insufficient mitigation.

We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving."}

We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence. Across diverse representative plug-and-play compression mechanisms and datasets, our results show that CAGE consistently achieves lower robust accuracy than the baseline. This work highlights that robustness assessments ignoring compression can be overly optimistic, calling for compression-aware security evaluation and defenses for efficient LVLMs."}

Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty. Bit perturbation experiments provide strong evidence that meaning is encoded in a distributional rather than compositional manner, as each bit's contribution depends on its surrounding pattern.

Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence property of the cross-modal gap function, ensuring the effectiveness of the proposed boosting scheme. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on widely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal learning baselines.

Moreover, when deployed in a new domain, these methods require obtaining the new paired data and subsequent retraining for model adaptation, which significantly increases computational overhead. Existing unsupervised methods have enabled to generate pseudo-labels based on cross-view similarity to infer the pairing relationships. However, geographical similarity and spatial continuity often cause visually analogous features at different geographical locations. The feature confusion compromises the reliability of pseudo-label generation, where incorrect pseudo-labels drive negative optimization. Given these challenges inherent in both supervised and unsupervised DVGL methods, we propose a novel cross-domain invariant knowledge transfer network (CDIKTNet) with limited supervision, whose architecture consists of a cross-domain invariance sub-network (CDIS) and a cross-domain transfer sub-network (CDTS). This architecture facilitates a closed-loop framework for invariance feature learning and knowledge transfer. The CDIS is designed to learn cross-view structural and spatial invariance from a small amount of paired data that serves as prior knowledge. It endows the shared feature space of unpaired data with similar implicit cross-view correlations at initialization, which alleviates feature confusion. Based on this, the CDTS employs dual-path contrastive learning to further optimize each subspace while preserving consistency in a shared feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDIKTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance under full supervision compared with those supervised methods, and further surpasses existing unsupervised methods in both few-shot and cross-domain initialization."}

However, these models assume that each test image's class label is drawn from a predefined label set and lack a reliable mechanism to reject samples from emerging unknown classes when only unlabeled data are available. To address this gap, open-set domain adaptation methods retrain models to push potential unknowns away from known clusters. Yet, some unknown samples remain stably anchored to specific known classes in the VLM feature space due to semantic relevance, which is termed as Semantic Affinity Anchoring (SAA). Forcibly repelling these samples unavoidably distorts the native geometry of VLMs and degrades performance. Meanwhile, existing score-based unknown detectors use simplistic thresholds and suffer from threshold sensitivity, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address aforementioned issues, we propose VLM-OpenXpert, which comprises two training-free, plug-and-play inference modules. SUFF performs SVD on high-confidence unknowns to extract a low-rank \"unknown subspace\". Each sample's projection onto this subspace is weighted and softly removed from its feature, suppressing unknown components while preserving semantics. BGAT corrects score skewness via a Box-Cox transform, then fits a bimodal Gaussian mixture to adaptively estimate the optimal threshold balancing known-class recognition and unknown-class rejection. Experiments on 9 benchmarks and three backbones (CLIP, SigLIP, ALIGN) under source-free OSDA settings show that our training-free pipeline matches or outperforms retraining-heavy state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful lightweight inference calibration paradigm for open-set VLM deployment."}

To address the need for faster density estimation for 3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative models that suffer from poor time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets.

This paper studies learning from noisy partial labels generated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes a collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) framework. Unlike symmetric noise commonly assumed in traditional noisy label learning, VLM-generated noise is instance-dependent and reflects the intrinsic biases of pre-trained models, posing greater challenges. To address this issue, we jointly train two neural networks to perform collaborative label purification via a co-pseudo-labeling mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization in both label and feature representation spaces. In addition, multiple anti-overfitting strategies are introduced, including alternating optimization of contrastive representations and pseudo-labels, as well as maintaining class prototypes in a shared feature space.

As a result, recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models. To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global optimality.

On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation learning and significant performance improvement.

We propose a novel Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder (EntroPE), as a temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. Extensive experiments on long-term forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection demonstrate that the proposed method improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series modeling.

Despite offering advantages like negligible computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP (Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational overhead during inference.

To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud.

We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications.

This bridge formulation effectively leverages the input video as a strong structural prior, guiding the model to perform precise removal while ensuring that the filled regions are logically consistent with the surrounding environment. To address the trade-off where strong bridge priors hinder the removal of large objects, we propose a novel adaptive mask modulation strategy.

To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment.

This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites."}

In this work, we show that invariance to roto-translations is insufficient to learn from measurements that only contain low-frequency information. Instead, we propose scale-equivariant imaging, a new self-supervised approach that leverages the fact that many image distributions are approximately scale-invariant, enabling the recovery of high-frequency information lost in the measurement process.

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation that employs representation-based evaluations of the unlearned model under large-scale scenarios to verify whether the unlearning approaches truly eliminate the targeted data from the model's representation perspective.

ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment and environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure, leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a weighted total variation-based regularization that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC, and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method.

We argue that the key mechanism for continual adaptation, without updating model parameters, is reflection: the agent's ability to use past experience to guide future actions. Empirical findings suggest that episodic, experience-driven reflection enables generalised adaptation across a wide range of open-ended, long-horizon tasks. This indicates that efficient learning can occur during deployment and weakens the traditional separation between training and testing. Motivated by this, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, a formal model of reflective memory dynamics. In this abstraction, an agent maintains an episodic memory and performs two core operations. Writing stores interaction outcomes and plays the role of policy evaluation. Reading retrieves relevant past cases to inform decisions and plays the role of policy improvement. This perspective treats reflective memory as a control object that can be analysed using classical reinforcement learning tools. We then develop a read-write reflective learning framework by integrating retrieval into soft policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. We show that as memory grows and provides denser coverage of the state space, the resulting composite policy converges to the optimal solution. Overall, this framework connects practical memory-based methods with principled reinforcement learning, providing a rigorous mathematical basis for building reflective, memory-embedded agents capable of continual general-purpose learning."}

However, what is deemed \"aesthetic\" is inextricably linked to personal taste and cultural values, raising the question of whose taste is represented in visual generative AI models. In this work, we study an aesthetic evaluation model--LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP)--that is widely used to curate datasets to train visual generative image models, like Stable Diffusion, and evaluate the quality of AI-generated images. To understand what LAP measures, we audited the model across three datasets. First, we examined the impact of aesthetic filtering on the LAION-Aesthetics Dataset (approximately 1.2B images), which was curated from LAION-5B using LAP. We find that the LAP disproportionally filters in images with captions mentioning women, while filtering out images with captions mentioning men or LGBTQ+ people. Then, we used LAP to score approximately 330k images across two art datasets, finding the model rates realistic images of landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits from western and Japanese artists most highly. In doing so, the algorithmic gaze of this aesthetic evaluation model reinforces the imperial and male gazes found within western art history. In order to understand where these biases may have originated, we performed a digital ethnography of public materials related to the creation of LAP. We find that the development of LAP reflects the biases we found in our audits, such as the aesthetic scores used to train LAP primarily coming from English-speaking photographers and western AI-enthusiasts. In response, we discuss how aesthetic evaluation can perpetuate representational harms and call on AI developers to shift away from prescriptive measures of \"aesthetics\" toward more pluralistic evaluation."}

We propose GUIGuard, a three-stage framework for privacy-preserving GUI agents: (1) privacy recognition, (2) privacy protection, and (3) task execution under protection. We further construct GUIGuard-Bench, a cross-platform benchmark with 630 trajectories and 13,830 screenshots, annotated with region-level privacy grounding and fine-grained labels of risk level, privacy category, and task necessity. Evaluations reveal that existing agents exhibit limited privacy recognition, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 13.3% accuracy on Android and 1.4% on PC. Under privacy protection, task-planning semantics can still be maintained, with closed-source models showing stronger semantic consistency than open-source ones. Case studies on MobileWorld show that carefully designed protection strategies achieve higher task accuracy while preserving privacy.

The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database.

In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning."}

Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO."}

To address this challenge, we propose SMKC, a framework that decouples the dynamic input structure from the anomaly detector. We first employ permutation-invariant feature hashing to sketch raw inputs into a fixed size state sequence. We then construct a hybrid kernel image to capture global temporal structure through pairwise comparisons of the sequence and its derivatives. The model learns normal patterns using masked reconstruction and a teacher-student prediction objective. Our evaluation reveals that robust log-distance channels provide the primary discriminative signal, whereas cosine representations often fail to capture sufficient contrast. Notably, we find that a detector using random projections and nearest neighbors on the SMKC representation performs competitively with fully trained baselines without requiring gradient updates.

Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process."}

Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation.

For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system.

We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines.

Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects."}

To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure.

To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully.

Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure.

While adversarial transfer within neural networks is well-documented, whether classical ML pipelines using handcrafted features inherit this vulnerability when attacked via neural surrogates remains unexplored. Feature engineering creates information bottlenecks through gradient quantization and spatial binning, potentially filtering high-frequency adversarial signals. We evaluate this hypothesis through the first comprehensive study of adversarial transfer from DNNs to HOG-based classifiers. Using VGG16 as a surrogate, we generate FGSM and PGD adversarial examples and test transfer to four classical classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM) and a shallow neural network across eight HOG configurations on CIFAR-10. Our results strongly refute the protective hypothesis: all classifiers suffer 16.6%-59.1% relative accuracy drops, comparable to neural-to-neural transfer. More surprisingly, we discover attack hierarchy reversal--contrary to patterns where iterative PGD dominates FGSM within neural networks, FGSM causes greater degradation than PGD in 100% of classical ML cases, suggesting iterative attacks overfit to surrogate-specific features that don't survive feature extraction. Block normalization provides partial but insufficient mitigation. These findings demonstrate that adversarial vulnerability is not an artifact of end-to-end differentiability but a fundamental property of image classification systems, with implications for security-critical deployments across computational paradigms."}

To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction.

Most existing studies focus on parameter uncertainty, such as variable processing times, and typically adopt the actor-critic framework. In this paper, we explore a different but prevalent form of uncertainty in JSSP: structural uncertainty. Structural uncertainty arises when a job may follow one of several routing paths, and the selection is determined not by policy, but by situational factors (e.g., the quality of intermediate products) that cannot be known in advance. Existing methods struggle to address this challenge due to incorrect credit assignment: a high-quality action may be unfairly penalized if it is followed by a time-consuming path. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named UP-AAC. In contrast to conventional actor-critic methods, UP-AAC employs an asymmetric architecture. While its actor receives a standard stochastic state, the critic is crucially provided with a deterministic state reconstructed in hindsight. This design allows the critic to learn a more accurate value function, which in turn provides a lower-variance policy gradient to the actor, leading to more stable learning. In addition, we design an attention-based Uncertainty Perception Model (UPM) to enhance the actor's scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in reducing makespan on benchmark instances."}

In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models.

In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks."}

We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners.

Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data).

To address both types of heterogeneity, we propose a novel graph Federated learning method via Semantic and Structural Alignment (FedSSA), which shares the knowledge of both node features and structural topologies. For node feature heterogeneity, we propose a novel variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, so that we can cluster clients based on inferred distributions and construct cluster-level representative distributions. We then minimize the divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing. For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing. Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning settings demonstrate that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods."}

In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling."}

We investigate the geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA), the premise that local updates coherently propagate to logical consequences. To formalize this, we adopt relation algebra and study three core operations on relations: negation flips truth values, converse swaps argument order, and composition chains relations. For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear. Since bilinearity is incompatible with negation, this forces the feature map to collapse. These results suggest that failures in knowledge editing, the reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning may stem from common structural limitations inherent to the LPA."}

To address this, we propose the Hessian Robust Quantization (HeRo Q) algorithm, which applies a lightweight, learnable rotation-compression matrix to the weight space prior to quantization. This joint framework reshapes the loss landscape by reducing the largest Hessian eigenvalue and reducing its max eigenvalue, thereby significantly enhancing robustness to quantization noise.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling."}

We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks.

We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the \"twist\" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii. Empirically, holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. It also tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize. Together, these results position representation holonomy as a practical and scalable diagnostic for probing the geometric structure of learned representations beyond pointwise similarity."}

We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites.

Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization."}

Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute.

Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability). Our findings reveal that this fairly attractive phenomenon could be either a hidden risk if misused or a mechanism that can be harnessed for developing models that require stronger capabilities and controllable behaviors."}

A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks."}

While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\\% more samples than PIDM."}

This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention.

MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting."}

To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling."}

As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP.

To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \\emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \\emph{(ii)} forming the $D \\times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality--scalability tradeoff. We introduce \\textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$.

This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation."}

We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\\textbf{R}$ea$\\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance."}

Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance.

In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements.

Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher).

However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) \"knowledge directions\". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy."}

We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives.

Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency.

This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm.

Existing approaches - routing and cascading - treat the LLM as an all-or-nothing resource: either the query bypasses the LLM entirely, or the LLM generates a complete response at full cost. We introduce LLM Shepherding, a framework that requests only a short prefix (a hint) from the LLM and provides it to SLM. This simple mechanism is surprisingly effective for math and coding tasks: even hints comprising 10-30% of the full LLM response improve SLM accuracy significantly. Shepherding generalizes both routing and cascading, and it achieves lower cost under oracle decision-making. We develop a two-stage predictor that jointly determines whether a hint is needed and how many tokens to request. On the widely-used mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, CNK12) and code generation (HumanEval, MBPP) benchmarks, Shepherding reduces costs by 42-94% relative to LLM-only inference.

State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the latency can be reduced by up to 14.9 % on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any accuracy degradation.The code is open source atthis https URL"}

This perspective particularly leverages the Rashomon Effect, where multiple models exhibit similar predictive performance but rely on diverse internal structures. Instead of considering these multiple models, choosing a single best model risks masking alternative narratives embedded in the data. To address this, we employed this perspective in the interpretation of a large-scale psychological dataset, specifically focusing on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. We use a random forest model combined with partial dependence profiles to rigorously assess the robustness and stability of predictive relationships across the resulting Rashomon set, which consists of multiple models that exhibit similar predictive performance. Our findings confirm that demographic variables \\texttt{age}, \\texttt{sex}, and \\texttt{education} lead to consistent structural shifts in anxiety and depression risk. Crucially, we identify significant temporal effects: risk probability demonstrates clear diurnal and circaseptan fluctuations, peaking during early morning hours. This work demonstrates the necessity of moving beyond the best model to analyze the entire Rashomon set.

Utilizing 8 strategically chosen SDGs, we identify a distributed causal network (i.e., no single 'hub' SDG), with 10 statistically significant Granger-causal relationships identified as 11 unique direct effects. Education to Inequality is identified as the most statistically significant direct relationship (r = -0.599; p < 0.05), while effect magnitude significantly varies depending on income levels (e.g., high-income: r = -0.65; lower-middle-income: r = -0.06; non-significant).

Moreover, existing sound-morphing methods target audio textures, music, or environmental sounds and are not transferable to voice identity manipulation. We propose VoxMorph, a zero-shot framework that produces high-fidelity voice morphs from as little as five seconds of audio per subject without model retraining. Our method disentangles vocal traits into prosody and timbre embeddings, enabling fine-grained interpolation of speaking style and identity. These embeddings are fused via Spherical Linear Interpolation (Slerp) and synthesized using an autoregressive language model coupled with a Conditional Flow Matching network. VoxMorph achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering a 2.6x gain in audio quality, a 73% reduction in intelligibility errors, and a 67.8% morphing attack success rate on automated speaker verification systems under strict security thresholds.

Although existing computational approaches have been proposed for site-of-metabolism prediction, they typically ignore cytochrome P450 isoform identity or model isoforms independently, thereby failing to fully capture inherent cross-isoform metabolic patterns. In addition, prior evaluations often rely on top-k metrics, where false positive atoms may be included among the top predictions, underscoring the need for complementary metrics that more directly assess binary atom-level discrimination under severe class imbalance. We propose ATTNSOM, an atom-level site-of-metabolism prediction framework that integrates intrinsic molecular reactivity with cross-isoform relationships. The model combines a shared graph encoder, molecule-conditioned atom representations, and a cross-attention mechanism to capture correlated metabolic patterns across cytochrome P450 isoforms. The model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets annotated with site-of-metabolism labels at atom resolution. Across these benchmarks, the model achieves consistently strong top-k performance across multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms.

This setup not only enables applicability across a range of practical scenarios, but also helps maximize model performance. However, the impact of prompt design remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of commonly used prompts across diverse datasets, showing that prompt choice significantly affects ASR performance and introduces instability, with no single prompt performing best across all cases. Inspired by the speech-to-LLM projector, we propose a prompt projector module, a simple, model-agnostic extension that learns to project prompt embeddings to more effective regions of the LLM input space, without modifying the underlying LLM-based ASR model.

Deep learning can accelerate imaging by reconstructing spectra from rapid, single-scan inputs. However, separating noise and baseline drift simultaneously without ground truth is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard black-box architectures often rely on statistical approximations that introduce spectral hallucinations or fail to generalize to unstable atmospheric conditions. To solve these issues we propose a physics-informed cascade Unet that separates denoising and baseline correction tasks using a new, deterministic Physics Bridge. This architecture forces the network to separate random noise from chemical signals using an embedded SNIP layer to enforce spectroscopic constraints instead of learning statistical approximations. We benchmarked this approach against a standard single Unet and a traditional Savitzky-Golay/SNIP workflow. We used a dataset of human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu). The cascade model outperformed all other methods, achieving a 51.3% reduction in RMSE compared to raw single-scan inputs, surpassing both the single Unet (40.2%) and the traditional workflow (33.7%). Peak-aware metrics show that the cascade architecture eliminates spectral hallucinations found in standard deep learning. It also preserves peak intensity with much higher fidelity than traditional smoothing. These results show that the cascade Unet is a robust solution for diagnostic-grade FTIR imaging. It enables imaging speeds 32 times faster than current methods."}

We are able now to establish domination results between these two upper bounds. We propose an ``augmented NLP bound'' based on a subtle convex relaxation. We provide theoretical guarantees, giving sufficient conditions under which the augmented NLP bound strictly dominates the ordinary NLP bound.

Most current BGs use classic MC mechanisms such as importance sampling, which both require tractable likelihoods from the backbone model and scale poorly in high-dimensional, multi-modal targets. We study BGs built on annealed Monte Carlo (aMC), which is designed to overcome these limitations by bridging a simple reference to the target through a sequence of intermediate densities. Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models and have already been incorporated into aMC-based recalibration schemes via the diffusion-induced density path, making them appealing backbones for aMC-BGs. We provide an empirical meta-analysis of DM-based aMC-BGs on controlled multi-modal Gaussian mixtures (varying mode separation, number of modes, and dimension), explicitly disentangling inference effects from learning effects by comparing (i) a perfectly learned DM and (ii) a DM trained from data. Even with a perfect DM, standard integrations using only first-order stochastic denoising kernels fail systematically, whereas second-order denoising kernels can substantially improve performance when covariance information is available. We further propose a deterministic aMC integration based on first-order transport maps derived from DMs, which outperforms the stochastic first-order variant at higher computational cost.

Thiemann,Gábor Csányi", "title": "Better without U: Impact of Selective Hubbard U Correction on Foundational MLIPs", "abstract": "The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems.Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement."}

At the same time, we embed entropy-stable design principles by jointly learning a convex entropy function and its associated flux potential, ensuring entropy dissipation and the selection of physically admissible weak solutions. A corresponding entropy-stable numerical flux scheme provides compatibility with standard discretizations, allowing seamless integration into classical solvers. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems, including Burgers, shallow water, Euler, and KPP equations, demonstrate that SymCLaw generalizes to unseen initial conditions, maintains stability under noisy training data, and achieves accurate long-time predictions, highlighting its potential as a principled foundation for data-driven modeling of hyperbolic conservation laws."}

A recent line of work shows that this need not be the case for UCB-type algorithms in multi-armed bandits. A central emerging theme is a `stability' property with asymptotically deterministic arm-pull counts in these algorithms, making inference as easy as in the i.i.d. setting.In this paper, we study the precise arm-pull dynamics in another canonical class of Thompson-sampling type algorithms. We show that the phenomenology is qualitatively different: the arm-pull count is asymptotically deterministic if and only if the arm is suboptimal or is the unique optimal arm; otherwise it converges in distribution to the unique invariant law of an SDE. This dichotomy uncovers a unifying principle behind many existing (in)stability results: an arm is stable if and only if its interaction with statistical noise is asymptotically negligible.As an application, we show that normalized arm means obey the same dichotomy, with Gaussian limits for stable arms and a semi-universal, non-Gaussian limit for unstable arms. This not only enables the construction of confidence intervals for the unknown mean rewards despite non-normality, but also reveals the potential of developing tractable inference procedures beyond the stable regime.The proofs rely on two new approaches. For suboptimal arms, we develop an `inverse process' approach that characterizes the inverse of the arm-pull count process via a Stieltjes integral. For optimal arms, we adopt a reparametrization of the arm-pull and noise processes that reduces the singularity in the natural SDE to proving the uniqueness of the invariant law of another SDE. We prove the latter by a set of analytic tools, including the parabolic Hörmander condition and the Stroock-Varadhan support theorem."}

To address this limitation, we propose {FRISM} (Fine-grained Reasoning Injection via Subspace-level model Merging), a fine-grained reasoning injection framework based on subspace-level model merging. Observing that reasoning capabilities are encoded in distinct subspaces, FRISM decomposes LRM task vectors via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and adaptively tunes the scaling coefficients of each subspace through learning to realize fine-grained reasoning injection. Furthermore, we introduce a label-free self-distillation learning strategy with a dual-objective optimization using common vision-language perception datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FRISM effectively improves reasoning capabilities without compromising the model's original visual capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks."}

The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process.

Refined notions of non-uniform and uniform generation were later introduced by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2025), and a noisy model was introduced by Raman and Raman (2025), which allows the adversary to insert extraneous strings. A natural question in the noisy model is to quantify the effect of noise, by studying the impact of each additional extraneous string. We show two complementary results in this setting. We first show that for both uniform and non-uniform generation, a single noisy string strictly reduces the set of collections that can be generated, thus answering an open question in Raman and Raman (2025). Then, we show for both uniform and non-uniform generation that generation with a single noisy string is equivalent to generation with any finite amount of noise, sharply contrasting with the strict hierarchy for noisy generation in the limit shown by Bai, Panigrahi, and Zhang (2026).

In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes.

By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

While Huber (linear-vacuous) contamination is a classical minimal-assumption model for an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of arbitrary perturbations, including it in an ambiguity set can make the worst-case risk infinite and the DRO objective vacuous unless one imposes strong boundedness or support assumptions. We address these challenges by introducing bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets: we learn a high-mass bulk set from data while considering contamination inside the bulk and bounding the remaining tail contribution separately. This leads to a closed-form, finite $\\mathrm{mean}+\\sup$ robust objective and tractable linear or second-order cone programs for common losses and bulk geometries. Through this framework, we highlight and exploit the equivalence between the imprecise probability (IP) notion of upper expectation and the worst-case risk, demonstrating how IP credal sets translate into DRO objectives with interpretable tolerance levels.

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality."}

We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread \"False Certification\" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a \"Trojan\" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance.

By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs.

Specifically, for any given test sample, PT probabilistically returns an interval, which is either null or constructed using an adjusted confidence level, thereby preserving marginal coverage. While PT potentially yields a deceptively lower interval length, it introduces practical vulnerabilities: the same input can yield completely different prediction intervals across repeated runs of the algorithm.

To overcome the issue, we propose the Adaptive meta Black-box Optimization Model (ABOM), which performs online parameter adaptation using solely optimization data from the target task, obviating the need for predefined task distributions. Unlike conventional metaBBO frameworks that decouple meta-training and optimization phases, ABOM introduces a closed-loop adaptive parameter learning mechanism, where parameterized evolutionary operators continuously self-update by leveraging generated populations during optimization.

We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood.

We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets).

Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

More data can make evaluation more confidently wrong under misspecified aggregation. We propose a judge-aware ranking framework that extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce model by introducing judge-specific discrimination parameters, jointly estimating latent model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons without reference labels. We establish identifiability up to natural normalizations and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, enabling confidence intervals for score differences and rank comparisons.

More precisely, we analyze deep Transformers where noise arises from the random initialization of value matrices. Under diffusion scaling and token-wise RMS normalization, we prove that, as the number of Transformer layers goes to infinity, the discrete token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system on the sphere where tokens are driven by a \\emph{common} matrix-valued Brownian noise. In this limit, we show that initialization noise prevents the collapse to a single cluster predicted by deterministic models.

Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning."}

This is achieved by eliminating redundancy in three aspects of CL: student model redundancy, teacher model redundancy, and rehearsal sample redundancy. By compressing the learnable parameters of the student model and pruning the teacher model, LoRD facilitates the retention and optimization of prior knowledge, effectively decoupling task-specific knowledge without manually assigning isolated parameters for each task. Furthermore, we optimize the selection of rehearsal samples and refine rehearsal frequency to improve training efficiency. Through a meticulous design of distillation and rehearsal strategies, LoRD effectively balances training efficiency and model precision.

We address this challenge by proposing Better Fair than Sorry (BFtS), a fair missing data imputation model for sensitive attributes. The key principle behind BFtS is that imputations should approximate the worst-case scenario for fairness -- i.e. when optimizing fairness is the hardest. We implement this idea using a 3-player adversarial scheme where two adversaries collaborate against a GNN classifier, and the classifier minimizes the maximum bias. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets show that BFtS often achieves a better fairness x accuracy trade-off than existing alternatives under an adversarial missingness process."}

One promising approach to this problem seeks to address these issues by leveraging changes in causal influences among latent variables. In this vein we propose a more general and relaxed framework than typically applied, formulated by imposing constraints on the function classes applied. Within this framework, we establish partial identifiability results under weaker conditions, including scenarios where only a subset of causal influences change.

Unlike traditional centralized approaches, federated learning enables training on data from multiple institutions while preserving patient privacy and complying with regulatory constraints. In practice, healthcare institutions (i.e., hosts) often need to build predictive models tailored to their specific needs (e.g., creatinine-level prediction, N-day readmission prediction) using federated learning. When building a federated learning model for a single healthcare institution, two key challenges arise: (1) ensuring compatibility across heterogeneous EHR systems, and (2) managing federated learning costs within budget constraints. Specifically, heterogeneity in EHR systems across institutions hinders compatible modeling, while the computational costs of federated learning can exceed practical budget limits for healthcare institutions. To address these challenges, we propose EHRFL, a federated learning framework designed for building a cost-effective, host-specific predictive model using patient EHR data. EHRFL consists of two components: (1) text-based EHR modeling, which facilitates cross-institution compatibility without costly data standardization, and (2) a participant selection strategy based on averaged patient embedding similarity to reduce the number of participants without degrading performance. Our participant selection strategy sharing averaged patient embeddings is differentially private, ensuring patient privacy. Experiments on multiple open-source EHR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of both components. With our framework, healthcare institutions can build institution-specific predictive models under budgetary constraints with reduced costs and time."}

Consequently, numerical methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM) are widely used. However, the FEM becomes computationally expensive as problem complexity and accuracy demands increase. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) improves the FEM by dynamically placing mesh elements on the domain, balancing computational speed and accuracy. Classical AMR depends on heuristics or expensive error estimators, which may lead to suboptimal performance for complex simulations. While AMR methods based on machine learning are promising, they currently only scale to simple problems. In this work, we formulate AMR as a system of collaborating, homogeneous agents that iteratively split into multiple new agents. This agent-wise perspective enables a spatial reward formulation focused on reducing the maximum mesh element error. Our approach, Adaptive Swarm Mesh Refinement++ (ASMR++), offers efficient, stable optimization and generates highly adaptive meshes at user-defined resolution at inference time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ASMR++ outperforms heuristic approaches and learned baselines, matching the performance of expensive error-based oracle AMR strategies. ASMR additionally generalizes to different domains during inference, and produces meshes that simulate up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than uniform refinements in more demanding settings."}

In this paper, we develop a combined human-algorithm approach to assist the FDA in improving its 510(k) medical device clearance process by reducing recall risk and regulatory workload. We first develop machine learning methods to estimate the risk of recall of 510(k) medical devices based on the information available at the time of submission. We then propose a data-driven clearance policy that recommends acceptance, rejection, or deferral to FDA's committees for in-depth evaluation. We conduct an empirical study using a unique dataset of over 31,000 submissions that we assembled based on data sources from the FDA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS). Compared to the FDA's current practice, which has a recall rate of 10.3% and a normalized workload measure of 100%, a conservative evaluation of our policy shows a 32.9% improvement in the recall rate and a 40.5% reduction in the workload. Our analyses further suggest annual cost savings of approximately $1.7 billion for the healthcare system driven by avoided replacement costs, which is equivalent to 1.1% of the entire United States annual medical device expenditure. Our findings highlight the value of a holistic and data-driven approach to improve the FDA's current 510(k) pathway."}

We show that coupling the data to an active non-Markovian bath creates a `memory effect' where high-level semantic information (such as class identity or molecular metastability) is stored in the temporal correlations of auxiliary degrees of freedom. Using Fisher information analysis, we prove that this active mechanism significantly retards the rate of information decay compared to passive Brownian motion. Crucially, this memory effect facilitates an earlier and more robust symmetry breaking (speciation) during the reverse generative process, allowing the system to resolve multi-scale structures, reminiscent of metastable states in molecular configurations that are washed out in the typical noising processes.

However, we observe two types of redundancy in NVFP4 encoding: (1) The FP4 element format naturally exposes an unused quantization value due to its sign-magnitude representation that contains both positive and negative zeros. (2) The FP8 block scaling factor has an unused sign bit because it is always positive. Additionally, we find that LLM weights are more tolerant to a lower-precision block scaling factor. Based on these observations, we propose Redundant Zero Remapping (RaZeR), an enhanced numerical format that pushes the limits of NVFP4 for more accurate LLM quantization under the same memory footprint. RaZeR leverages the redundant bits of the block scaling factor to adaptively remap the redundant FP4 zero to additional quantization values with improved accuracy. To demonstrate the practicality of RaZeR, we design efficient GPU kernels for RaZeR-quantized LLM inference and propose novel hardware to natively support this. Extensive experiments validate RaZeR's superior performance for 4-bit LLM quantization. For example, relative to native NVFP4, RaZeR reduces the average perplexity loss by 34.6% and 31.2% under weight-only and weight-activation quantization, respectively."}

To address this issue, we uncover the Satisficing Generalization Edge, which we validate both theoretically and experimentally: identifying a set of promising actions is inherently more generalizable than selecting the single optimal action. To exploit this property, we propose Adaptive Selection After Proposal (ASAP), a generic framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two distinct phases: a proposal policy that acts as a robust filter, and a selection policy as an adaptable decision maker. This architecture enables a highly effective online adaptation strategy where the selection policy can be rapidly fine-tuned on a new distribution. Concretely, we introduce a two-phase training framework enhanced by Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to prime the model for fast adaptation.

Several trade-offs arise here - e.g., sampling a larger number of arms together results in a wider view of the environment, while sampling fewer arms enhances the information about individual reward distributions. Furthermore, grouping a large number of suboptimal arms together albeit reduces the variance of the reward of the group, it may enhance the group mean to make it close to that containing the optimal arm.

Current AI models, despite extensive training, still struggle to achieve similar generalization, especially in Out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. This limitation stems from their inability to abstract core physical principles from observations. A key challenge is developing representations that can efficiently learn and generalize physical dynamics from minimal data. Here we present Neural Force Field (NFF), a framework extending Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) to learn complex object interactions through force field representations, which can be efficiently integrated through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to predict object trajectories. Unlike existing approaches that rely on discrete latent spaces, NFF captures fundamental physical concepts such as gravity, support, and collision in continuous explicit force fields. Experiments on three challenging physical reasoning tasks demonstrate that NFF, trained with only a few examples, achieves strong generalization to unseen scenarios. This physics-grounded representation enables efficient forward-backward planning and rapid adaptation through interactive refinement.

In line with this trend, several recent studies have questioned the necessity of architectural features commonly found in MD models, such as built-in rotational equivariance or energy conservation. In this work, we contribute to the ongoing discussion by evaluating the performance of an MD model with as few specialized architectural features as possible. We present a recipe for MD using an Edge Transformer, an ``off-the-shelf'' transformer architecture that has been minimally modified for the MD domain, termed MD-ET.

Additionally, we examine the effects of being only approximately equivariant and energy conserving for MD simulations, proposing a novel method for distinguishing the errors resulting from non-equivariance from other sources of inaccuracies like numerical rounding errors. While our model exhibits runaway energy increases on larger structures, we show approximately energy-conserving NVE simulations for a range of small structures."}

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation that employs representation-based evaluations of the unlearned model under large-scale scenarios to verify whether the unlearning approaches truly eliminate the targeted data from the model's representation perspective. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art unlearning approaches either completely degrade the representational quality of the unlearned model or merely modify the classifier, thereby achieving superior logit-based performance while maintaining representational similarity to the original model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel unlearning evaluation scenario in which the forgetting classes exhibit semantic similarity to downstream task classes, necessitating that feature representations diverge significantly from those of the original model, thus enabling a more thorough evaluation from a representation perspective.

Torr,Mark Coates", "title": "Plain Transformers Can be Powerful Graph Learners", "abstract": "Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, owing to their simple but powerful scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers (GTs) have strayed far from plain Transformers, exhibiting major architectural differences either by integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These divergences hinder the easy adoption of training advances for Transformers developed in other domains. Contrary to previous GTs, this work demonstrates that the plain Transformer architecture can be a powerful graph learner. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate three simple, minimal, and easy-to-implement modifications to the plain Transformer architecture to construct our Powerful Plain Graph Transformers (PPGT): (1) simplified $L_2$ attention for measuring the magnitude closeness among tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a simple MLP-based stem for graph positional encoding. Consistent with its theoretical expressivity, PPGT demonstrates noteworthy realized expressivity on the empirical graph expressivity benchmark, comparing favorably to more complicated alternatives such as subgraph GNNs and higher-order GNNs. Its empirical performance across various graph datasets also justifies the effectiveness of PPGT. This finding underscores the versatility of plain Transformer architectures and highlights their strong potential as a unified backbone for multimodal learning across language, vision, and graph domains."}

In the pre-training stage, APF incorporates node-specific subgraphs selected via the Rayleigh Quotient, a label-free anomaly metric, into the learning objective to enhance anomaly awareness. It further introduces two learnable spectral polynomial filters to jointly learn dual representations that capture both general semantics and subtle anomaly cues.

High-level GPU programming languages, such as Triton, rely on compiler heuristics to generate dataflow, layouts, and pipelining strategies in GPU programs.

To balance expressiveness and programmability, we propose Hexcute, a compiler framework that automates layout synthesis while providing explicit control over dataflow and pipelining. Hexcute formalizes layout synthesis as a constraint programming problem and solves it with a type-inference-based algorithm. This approach enables systematic exploration of optimal layouts and instructions.Our evaluation shows that Hexcute matches the performance of libraries like cuBLAS and FlashAttention on GEMM, Attention, and their variants, while reducing the amount of code by 1.27$\\times$-7.94$\\times$ compared to CUTLASS.

In contrast, embedding evolution remains largely unexplored, which often drives models toward brute-force embedding lengthening to improve approximation, but at the cost of substantially increased computation.In this paper, we introduce an auxiliary dimension that explicitly models embedding evolution in operator form, thereby redefining the NO framework in $d+1$ dimensions (the original $d$ dimensions plus one auxiliary dimension).

This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.

In this work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.

Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods."}

To bridge these gaps, we conduct an extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive evaluations under the same conditions for fair comparison. To our knowledge, such a fair and extensive investigation remains critically underexplored. To better understand connections, first, we decouple published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization transformation and quantization error mitigation. The former is a preprocessing step that reduces outlier impact by flattening the data distribution; the latter offsets quantization errors to improve performance. Second, we evaluate and analyze the impact of different settings, including granularity and symmetry. Third, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 and NVFP4 data formats and their performance. Our experiments first demonstrate that optimized rotation and scaling yield the best pre-quantization performance, and that combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ can occasionally outperform GPTQ alone for error mitigation. Second, finer granularity improves performance but increases storage overhead.

Although this architecture has attained substantial success, the coupling between representation and value learning creates instability as representations must constantly adapt to non-stationary value targets, while value estimates depend on these shifting representations. This is compounded by high variance in bootstrapped targets, which causes bias in value estimation in off-policy methods. We introduce Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER), a framework for value-based RL that views representation and Q-learning as two strategic agents in a hierarchical game. SCORER models the Q-function as the leader, which commits to its strategy by updating less frequently, while the perception network (encoder) acts as the follower, adapting more frequently to learn representations that minimize Bellman error variance given the leader's committed strategy. Through this division of labor, the Q-function minimizes MSBE while perception minimizes its variance, thereby reducing bias accordingly, with asymmetric updates allowing stable co-adaptation, unlike simultaneous parameter updates in monolithic solutions. Our proposed SCORER framework leads to a bi-level optimization problem whose solution is approximated by a two-timescale algorithm that creates an asymmetric learning dynamic between the two players. Extensive experiments on DQN and its variants demonstrate that gains stem from algorithmic insight rather than model complexity."}

Our analysis reveals two unexpected and robust structural changes: (1) a near-uniform geometric scaling of singular values across layers; and (2) highly consistent orthogonal transformations are applied to the left and right singular vectors of each matrix. Based on these findings, We propose a simple yet effective framework to describe the coordinated dynamics of parameters in LLMs, which elucidates why post-training inherently relies on the foundational capabilities developed during pre-training. Further experiments demonstrate that singular value scaling underpins the temperature-controlled regulatory mechanisms of post-training, while the coordinated rotation of singular vectors encodes the essential semantic alignment.

Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2) all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse.

In this paper, we propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set, yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that, unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods."}

We propose Neural Weight Compression (NWC), a flexible framework for training neural codecs on pretrained weight datasets. NWC addresses challenges intrinsic to weight compression, such as tensor shape heterogeneity and the misalignment between training losses and downstream performance, through components such as chunk-and-normalize preprocessing and an importance-aware training objective.

We propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR) objective.

Like downloadable content in software, DLC serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4\\% of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8\\% improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency.

Recent works in mechanistic interpretability have widely reported that neural networks represent meaningful concepts as linear directions in their representation spaces and often encode diverse concepts in superposition. Various sparse dictionary learning (SDL) methods, including sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders, are utilized to address this by training auxiliary models with sparsity constraints to disentangle these superposed concepts into monosemantic features. These methods are the backbone of modern mechanistic interpretability, yet in practice they consistently produce polysemantic features, feature absorption, and dead neurons, with very limited theoretical understanding of why these phenomena occur. Existing theoretical work is limited to tied-weight sparse autoencoders, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. We develop the first unified theoretical framework that casts all major SDL variants as a single piecewise biconvex optimization problem, and characterize its global solution set, non-identifiability, and spurious optima. This analysis yields principled explanations for feature absorption and dead neurons. To expose these pathologies under full ground-truth access, we introduce the Linear Representation Bench. Guided by our theory, we propose feature anchoring, a novel technique that restores SDL identifiability, substantially improving feature recovery across synthetic benchmarks and real neural representations."}

The key challenge lies in the model's inability to distinguish between correct and erroneous tokens in a visible sequence. Standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training is restricted to the objective of unmasking, undermining the effectiveness of refinement guided by confidence. Based on this observation, we study corrective behavior in DLMs, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a post-training principle oriented by correction that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling discriminative confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark, a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and parallel decoding scenarios demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs, with gains that are most pronounced when parallel decoding introduces substantial uncertainty and iterative refinement becomes essential.

In this paper, we propose a Kernel Alignment-based multi-view unsupervised FeatUre selection with Sample-level adaptive graph lEarning method (KAFUSE) to address these issues. Specifically, we first employ kernel alignment with an orthogonal constraint to reduce feature redundancy in both linear and nonlinear relationships. Then, a cross-view consistent similarity graph is learned by applying sample-level fusion to each slice of a tensor formed by stacking similarity graphs from different views, which automatically adjusts the view weights for each sample during fusion.

Existing approaches either enforce a unified rank or align heterogeneous updates into a single shared subspace, which tends to mix transferable and client-specific directions and consequently undermines personalization. Moreover, under differential privacy (DP), perturbing such structurally mixed updates injects noise into directions that should remain purely local, leading to unnecessary utility degradation. To address these issues, we propose Selective Decoupled Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), a structure-aware LoRA framework that decouples each client update into a shared component for aggregation and a private component that preserves client-specific semantics. Only the shared component participates in subspace alignment, while the private component remains local and uncommunicated, making the training DP-compatible and stabilizing aggregation under rank heterogeneity.

We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, policy gradient drives the Transformer to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of \"simple examples\": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler examples, the Transformer learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, policy gradient learning becomes infeasible.

A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios."}

Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem.

In this work, we study the scaling behavior in a transfer learning setting, where LLMs are finetuned for machine translation tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the choice of the pretraining data and its size affect downstream performance (translation quality) as judged by: downstream cross-entropy and translation quality metrics such as BLEU and COMET scores. Our experiments indicate that the size of the finetuning dataset and the distribution alignment between the pretraining and downstream data significantly influence the scaling behavior. With sufficient alignment, both downstream cross-entropy and translation quality scores improve monotonically with more pretraining data. In such cases, we show that it is possible to predict the downstream translation quality metrics with good accuracy using a log-law. However, there are cases where moderate misalignment causes the downstream translation scores to fluctuate or get worse with more pretraining, whereas downstream cross-entropy monotonically improves. By analyzing these, we provide new practical insights for choosing appropriate pretraining data."}

We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress.

Under this paradigm, we empirically find that existing attacks overlook the inherent deficiency in how diffusion models process high-frequency information. Consequently, this deficiency leads to member data with more high-frequency content being misclassified as hold-out data, and hold-out data with less high-frequency content tend to be misclassified as member data. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that this deficiency reduces the membership advantage of attacks, thereby interfering with the effective discrimination of member data and hold-out data. Based on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play high-frequency filter module to mitigate the adverse effects of the deficiency, which can be seamlessly integrated into any attacks within this general paradigm without additional time costs. Extensive experiments corroborate that this module significantly improves the performance of baseline attacks across different datasets and models."}

Tokenization, Transparency, and Incentives", "abstract": "State-of-the-art large language models require specialized hardware and substantial energy to operate. As a consequence, cloud-based services that provide access to large language models have become very popular. In these services, the price users pay for an output provided by a model depends on the number of tokens the model uses to generate it: they pay a fixed price per token. In this work, we show that this pricing mechanism creates a financial incentive for providers to strategize and misreport the (number of) tokens a model used to generate an output, and users cannot prove, or even know, whether a provider is overcharging them. However, we also show that, if an unfaithful provider is obliged to be transparent about the generative process used by the model, misreporting optimally without raising suspicion is hard. Nevertheless, as a proof-of-concept, we develop an efficient heuristic algorithm that allows providers to significantly overcharge users without raising suspicion. Crucially, we demonstrate that the cost of running the algorithm is lower than the additional revenue from overcharging users, highlighting the vulnerability of users under the current pay-per-token pricing mechanism. Further, we show that, to eliminate the financial incentive to strategize, a pricing mechanism must price tokens linearly on their character count. While this makes a provider's profit margin vary across tokens, we introduce a simple prescription under which the provider who adopts such an incentive-compatible pricing mechanism can maintain the average profit margin they had under the pay-per-token pricing mechanism. Along the way, to illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the $\\texttt{Llama}$, $\\texttt{Gemma}$ and $\\texttt{Ministral}$ families, and input prompts from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform."}

These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics."}

However, this data is prone to various biases, and training an LTR algorithm directly on biased data can result in suboptimal ranking performance. One of the most prominent and well-studied biases in implicit feedback data is position bias, which occurs because users are more likely to interact with higher-ranked items regardless of their true relevance. In this paper, we propose a novel control function-based method that accounts for position bias in a two-stage process. The first stage uses exogenous variation from the residuals of the ranking process to correct for position bias in the second stage click equation. Unlike previous position bias correction methods, our method does not require knowledge of the click or propensity model and allows for nonlinearity in the underlying ranking model. Moreover, our method is general and allows for debiasing any state-of-the-art ranking algorithm by plugging it into the second stage. We also introduce a new technique to debias validation clicks for hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal model in the absence of unbiased validation data. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in correcting for position bias."}

To address these challenges, we propose POLAR, a novel pessimistic model-based policy learning algorithm for offline DTR optimization. POLAR estimates the transition dynamics from offline data and quantifies uncertainty for each history-action pair. A pessimistic penalty is then incorporated into the reward function to discourage actions with high uncertainty. Unlike many existing methods that focus on average training performance or provide guarantees only for an oracle policy, POLAR directly targets the suboptimality of the final learned policy and offers theoretical guarantees, without relying on computationally intensive minimax or constrained optimization procedures. To the best of our knowledge, POLAR is the first model-based DTR method to provide both statistical and computational guarantees, including finite-sample bounds on policy suboptimality.

When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced.

Although prior research has focused on adversarial attacks on specific ML models, this study expands the scope by investigating vulnerabilities within various components of the entire CTI pipeline and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks.

We analyse three types of attacks against CTI pipelines, including evasion, flooding, and poisoning, and assess their impact on the system's information selection capabilities. Specifically, on fake text generation, the work demonstrates how adversarial text generation techniques can create fake cybersecurity and cybersecurity-like text that misleads classifiers, degrades performance, and disrupts system functionality.

To fill the gap, this study introduces an interpretable stochastic modeling framework that captures not only context-dependent dynamics but also residual variability beyond what context can explain. Leveraging deep neural networks integrated with nonstationary Gaussian processes (GPs), our model employs a scenario-adaptive Gibbs kernel to learn dynamic temporal correlations in acceleration decisions, where the strength and duration of correlations between acceleration decisions evolve with the driving context. This formulation enables a principled, data-driven quantification of uncertainty in acceleration, speed, and spacing, grounded in both observable context and latent behavioral variability. Comprehensive experiments on the naturalistic vehicle trajectory dataset collected from the German highway, i.e., the HighD dataset, demonstrate that the proposed stochastic simulation method within this framework surpasses conventional methods in both predictive performance and interpretable uncertainty quantification. The integration of interpretability and accuracy makes this framework a promising tool for traffic analysis and safety-critical applications."}

This makes it a challenge in a model comparison setting, where multiple statistical models are considered, of which at least some are misspecified. Recent work on self-consistency (SC) provides a promising remedy to this issue, accessible even for empirical data (without ground-truth labels). In this work, we investigate how SC can improve amortized model comparison conceptualized in four different ways. Across two synthetic and two real-world case studies, we find that approaches for model comparison that estimate marginal likelihoods through approximate parameter posteriors consistently outperform methods that directly approximate model evidence or posterior model probabilities. SC training improves robustness when the likelihood is available, even under severe model misspecification. The benefits of SC for methods without access of analytic likelihoods are more limited and inconsistent.

A tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed, even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv) that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through extensive experiments across open-source models (e.g. Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1, Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited protection against this diversity-driven failure mode."}

Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair (PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches, requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies."}

Prior training-free KV cache offloading alleviates this by keeping redundant context on the CPU and fetching only a sparse subset for attention, but it often degrades long-generation quality due to training-inference mismatch on sparse patterns. Meanwhile, trainable sparse attention is incompatible with efficient offloading, as unconstrained KV accesses may force large CPU-to-GPU transfers and erase throughput gains. To this end, we propose NOSA, a trainable sparse attention mechanism natively designed for KV cache offloading. NOSA explicitly constrains the volume of CPU-GPU KV transfers, thereby achieving low communication overhead and high decoding throughput. We further build NOSI, a KV cache offloading inference system that fully unlocks NOSA's efficiency.

Across three real-world mRNA datasets spanning two orders of magnitude in size, RNAGenScape increases median property gain by up to 148% and success rate by up to 30% while ensuring biological viability of generated sequences, and achieves competitive inference efficiency relative to existing generative approaches."}

Under partial observability, dynamical systems are naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) -- intractable. We address these challenges by deriving new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our approach leverages nested particle filters for efficient online state-parameter inference with convergence guarantees.

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation."}

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient.

To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances.

We argue that the key mechanism for continual adaptation, without updating model parameters, is reflection: the agent's ability to use past experience to guide future actions. Empirical findings suggest that episodic, experience-driven reflection enables generalised adaptation across a wide range of open-ended, long-horizon tasks. This indicates that efficient learning can occur during deployment and weakens the traditional separation between training and testing. Motivated by this, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, a formal model of reflective memory dynamics. In this abstraction, an agent maintains an episodic memory and performs two core operations. Writing stores interaction outcomes and plays the role of policy evaluation. Reading retrieves relevant past cases to inform decisions and plays the role of policy improvement. This perspective treats reflective memory as a control object that can be analysed using classical reinforcement learning tools. We then develop a read-write reflective learning framework by integrating retrieval into soft policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. We show that as memory grows and provides denser coverage of the state space, the resulting composite policy converges to the optimal solution. Overall, this framework connects practical memory-based methods with principled reinforcement learning, providing a rigorous mathematical basis for building reflective, memory-embedded agents capable of continual general-purpose learning."}

In this work, we introduce a compact prediction-reconstruction architecture with a dedicated feedback pathway providing lightweight, locally trainable temporal context for continual adaptation. All synapses are updated by a unified local rule combining centered Hebbian covariance, Oja-style stabilization, and a local supervised drive where targets are available. With a simple two-pair association task, learning is characterized through layer-wise activity snapshots, connectivity trajectories (row and column means of learned weights), and a normalized retention index across phases. Under sequential A to B training, forward output connectivity exhibits a long-term depression (LTD)-like suppression of the earlier association, while feedback connectivity preserves an A-related trace during acquisition of B. Under an alternating sequence, both associations are concurrently maintained rather than sequentially suppressed. Architectural controls and rule-term ablations isolate the role of dedicated feedback in regeneration and co-maintenance, alongside the role of the local supervised term in output selectivity and unlearning.

Under a probabilistic view, we hypothesise that four symmetries (inference equivariance, information invariance, concept-closure invariance, and structural invariance) suffice to (i) formalise interpretable models as a subclass of probabilistic models, (ii) yield a unified formulation of interpretable inference (e.g., alignment, interventions, and counterfactuals) as a form of Bayesian inversion, and (iii) provide a formal framework to verify compliance with safety standards and regulations."}

Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics."}

These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1."}

How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs.

We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software engineering workflows for tasks including code generation, summarization, repair, and testing. Empirical studies report productivity gains, improved comprehension, and reduced cognitive load. However, evidence remains fragmented, and concerns persist about hallucinations, unstable outputs, methodological limitations, and emerging forms of technical debt. How these mixed effects shape long-term software maintainability and evolvability remains unclear. Objectives. This study systematically examines how LLMs influence the maintainability and evolvability of software systems. We identify which quality attributes are addressed in existing research, the positive impacts LLMs provide, the risks and weaknesses they introduce, and the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review. Searches across ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus (2020 to 2024) yielded 87 primary studies. Qualitative evidence was extracted through a calibrated multi-researcher process. Attributes were analyzed descriptively, while impacts, risks, weaknesses, and mitigation strategies were synthesized using a hybrid thematic approach supported by an LLM-assisted analysis tool with human-in-the-loop validation. Results. LLMs provide benefits such as improved analyzability, testability, code comprehension, debugging support, and automated repair. However, they also introduce risks, including hallucinated or incorrect outputs, brittleness to context, limited domain reasoning, unstable performance, and flaws in current evaluations, which threaten long-term evolvability. Conclusion. LLMs can strengthen maintainability and evolvability, but they also pose nontrivial risks to long-term sustainability.

A Critical Analysis of Systematic Literature Reviews on Agile Effort and Cost Estimation", "abstract": "Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become prevalent in software engineering research. Several researchers may conduct SLRs on similar topics without a prospective register for SLR protocols. However, even ignoring these unavoidable duplications of effort in the simultaneous conduct of SLRs, the proliferation of overlapping and often repetitive SLRs indicates that researchers are not extensively checking for existing SLRs on a topic. Given how effort-intensive it is to design, conduct, and report an SLR, the situation is less than ideal for software engineering research. Aim: To understand how authors justify additional SLRs on a topic. Method: To illustrate the issue and develop suggestions for improvement to address this issue, we have intentionally picked a sufficiently narrow but well-researched topic, i.e., effort estimation in Agile software development. We identify common justification patterns through a qualitative content analysis of 18 published SLRs. We further consider the citation data, publication years, publication venues, and the quality of the SLRs when interpreting the results. Results: The common justification patterns include authors claiming gaps in coverage, methodological limitations in prior studies, temporal obsolescence of previous SLRs, or rapid technological and methodological advancements necessitating updated syntheses. Conclusion: Our in-depth analysis of SLRs on a fairly narrow topic provides insights into SLRs in software engineering in general. By emphasizing the need for identifying existing SLRs and for justifying the undertaking of further SLRs, both in design and review guidelines and as a policy of conferences and journals, we can reduce the likelihood of duplication of effort and increase the rate of progress in the field."}

We propose three requirements for responsible AI-assisted engineering: (1) epistemic layers that separate unverified hypotheses from empirically validated claims, (2) conservative assurance aggregation grounded in the Gödel t-norm that prevents weak evidence from inflating confidence, and (3) automated evidence decay tracking that surfaces stale assumptions before they cause failures. We formalize these requirements as the First Principles Framework (FPF), ground its aggregation semantics in fuzzy logic, and define a quintet of invariants that any valid aggregation operator must satisfy. Our retrospective audit applying FPF criteria to two internal projects found that 20-25% of architectural decisions had stale evidence within two months, validating the need for temporal accountability. We outline research directions including learnable aggregation operators, federated evidence sharing, and SMT-based claim validation."}

This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of bugs in real-world TypeScript projects. We analyze 633 bug reports from 16 popular open-source repositories to construct a taxonomy of fault types, quantify their prevalence, and relate them to project characteristics such as size, domain, and dependency composition. Our results reveal a fault landscape dominated not by logic or syntax errors but by tooling and configuration faults, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues. We show that these categories correlate strongly with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity, indicating that modern failures often arise at integration and orchestration boundaries rather than within algorithmic logic. A longitudinal comparison with JavaScript studies shows that while static typing in TypeScript has reduced traditional runtime and type errors, it has shifted fragility toward build systems and toolchains. These findings offer new insight into how language design and ecosystem evolution reshape the fault profiles of large-scale software systems."}

This paper presents an empirical study of 6,582 human-agent PRs (HAPRs) and 3,122 human PRs (HPRs) from the AIDev dataset. We compare HAPRs and HPRs along three dimensions: (i) testing frequency and extent, (ii) types of testing-related changes (code-and-test co-evolution vs. test-focused), and (iii) testing quality, measured by test smells. Our findings reveal that, although the likelihood of including tests is comparable (42.9% for HAPRs vs. 40.0% for HPRs), HAPRs exhibit a larger extent of testing, nearly doubling the test-to-source line ratio found in HPRs. While test-focused task distributions are comparable, HAPRs are more likely to add new tests during co-evolution (OR=1.79), whereas HPRs prioritize modifying existing tests. Finally, although some test smell categories differ statistically, negligible effect sizes suggest no meaningful differences in quality.

However, the efficacy of existing UI testing techniques is often limited, especially in terms of coverage. Recent studies, including the state-of-the-art, struggle to achieve more than 30% activity coverage in real-world apps. This limited coverage can be attributed to a combination of factors such as failing to generate complex user inputs, unsatisfied activation conditions regarding device configurations and external resources, and hard-to-reach code paths that are not easily accessible through the GUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose CovAgent, a novel agentic AI-powered approach to enhance Android app UI testing. Our fuzzer-agnostic framework comprises an AI agent that inspects the app's decompiled Smali code and component transition graph, and reasons about unsatisfied activation conditions within the app code logic that prevent access to the activities that are unreachable by standard and widely adopted GUI fuzzers. Then, another agent generates dynamic instrumentation scripts that satisfy activation conditions required for successful transitions to those activities. We found that augmenting existing fuzzing approaches with our framework achieves a significant improvement in test coverage over the state-of-the-art, LLMDroid, and other baselines such as Fastbot and APE (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3% and 179.7% higher activity coverage, respectively). CovAgent also outperforms all the baselines in other metrics such as class, method, and line coverage. We also conduct investigations into components within CovAgent to reveal further insights regarding the efficacy of Agentic AI in the field of automated app testing such as the agentic activation condition inference accuracy, and agentic activity-launching success rate."}

Using a vignette-based survey, we quantified the prevalence of these biases, identified the demographics most affected, assessed their consequences, and explored the motivations behind biased actions. Our results show that career development and task selection biases are the most prevalent forms, with over two-thirds of victims experiencing them multiple times. Women were more than three times as likely as men to face career development bias, task selection bias, and an unwelcoming environment. In parallel, individuals from marginalized ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately targeted by identity attacks. Our analysis also confirms that, beyond gender and race, factors such as age, years of experience, organization size, and geographic location are significant predictors of bias victimization."}

To increase the comprehensiveness of this problem, we investigate and evaluate the characteristics of LLM to know the pull requests' characteristics beyond the pass rate. We observe the code quality and maintainability within PRs based on code metrics to evaluate objective characteristics and developers' reactions to the pull requests from both humans and LLM's generation. Evaluation results indicate that LLM Agents frequently disregard code reuse opportunities, resulting in higher levels of redundancy compared to human developers. In contrast to the quality issues, our emotions analysis reveals that reviewers tend to express more neutral or positive emotions towards AI-generated contributions than human ones.

Recent studies have used Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) and Language Models (LMs) to capture commit intent, demonstrating that Small Language Models (SLMs) can approach the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining efficiency and privacy. However, they do not address tangled commits involving multiple concerns, leaving the feasibility of using LMs for multi-concern detection unresolved. In this paper, we frame multi-concern detection in tangled commits as a multi-label classification problem and construct a controlled dataset of artificially tangled commits based on real-world data. We then present an empirical study using SLMs to detect multiple semantic concerns in tangled commits, examining the effects of fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and header-preserving truncation under practical token-budget limits. Our results show that a fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM is competitive with a state-of-the-art LLM for single-concern commits and remains usable for up to three concerns. In particular, including commit messages improves detection accuracy by up to 44% (in terms of Hamming Loss) with negligible latency overhead, establishing them as important semantic cues."}

We study the usage patterns of 147 professional developers, examining perceived correlates of AI tools use, the resulting productivity and quality outcomes, and developer readiness for emerging AI-enhanced development. We describe a virtuous adoption cycle where frequent and broad AI tools use are the strongest correlates of both Perceived Productivity (PP) and quality, with frequency strongest. The study finds no perceptual support for the Quality Paradox and shows that PP is positively correlated with Perceived Code Quality (PQ) improvement. Developers thus report both productivity and quality gains. High current usage, breadth of application, frequent use of AI tools for testing, and ease of use correlate strongly with future intended adoption, though security concerns remain a moderate and statistically significant barrier to adoption. Moreover, AI testing tools' adoption lags that of coding tools, opening a Testing Gap. We identify three developer archetypes (Enthusiasts, Pragmatists, Cautious) that align with an innovation diffusion process wherein the virtuous adoption cycle serves as the individual engine of progression. Our findings reveal that organizational adoption of AI tools follows such a process: Enthusiasts push ahead with tools, creating organizational success that converts Pragmatists. The Cautious are held in organizational stasis: without early adopter examples, they don't enter the virtuous adoption cycle, never accumulate the usage frequency that drives intent, and never attain high efficacy. Policy itself does not predict individuals' intent to increase usage but functions as a marker of maturity, formalizing the successful diffusion of adoption by Enthusiasts while acting as a gateway that the Cautious group has yet to reach."}

While existing research has explored developer-AI interactions when programming qualitatively, a significant gap remains in quantitative analysis of developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions, partly because the necessary fine-grained interaction data is often proprietary. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts an empirical study using 66,329 industrial developer-AI interactions from a large technology company. We analyze features that are significantly different between accepted code suggestions and rejected ones. We find that accepted suggestions are characterized by significantly higher historical acceptance counts and ratios for both developers and projects, longer generation intervals, shorter preceding code context in the project, and older IDE versions. Based on these findings, we introduce CSAP (Code Suggestion Acceptance Prediction) to predict whether a developer will accept the code suggestion before it is displayed. Our evaluation of CSAP shows that it achieves the accuracy of 0.973 and 0.922 on imbalanced and balanced dataset respectively. Compared to a large language model baseline and an in-production industrial filter, CSAP relatively improves the accuracy by 12.6\\% and 69.5\\% on imbalanced dataset, and improves the accuracy by 87.0\\% and 140.1\\% on balanced dataset. Our results demonstrate that targeted personalization is a powerful approach for filtering out code suggestions with predicted rejection and reduce developer interruption. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first quantitative study of code suggestion acceptance on large-scale industrial data, and this work also sheds light on an important research direction of AI-assisted programming."}

All existing tools to detect OOBs in GPU programs rely on runtime techniques that require an OOB to manifest for detection. Thus, input-dependent OOBs elude them. We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs.We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints. It further analyzes GPU code to track logical partitioning of memory allocations for detecting intra-allocation OOB.

Existing studies on blockchain RPC bug detection mainly focus on generating the RPC method calls for testing blockchain clients. However, a wide range of the reported RPC bugs are triggered in various blockchain contexts. To the best of our knowledge, little attention is paid to generating proper contexts that can trigger these context-dependent RPC bugs.In this work, we propose EthCRAFT, a Context-aware RPC Analysis and Fuzzing Tool for client RPC bug detection. EthCRAFT first proposes to explore the state transition program space of blockchain clients and generate various transactions to construct the context. EthCRAFT then designs a context-aware RPC method call generation method to send RPC calls to the blockchain clients. The responses of 5 different client implementations are used as cross-referring oracles to detect the RPC bugs. We evaluate EthCRAFT on real-world RPC bugs collected from the GitHub issues of Ethereum client implementations. Experiment results show that EthCRAFT outperforms existing client RPC detectors by detecting more RPC bugs. Moreover, EthCRAFT has found six new bugs in major Ethereum clients and reported them to the developers. One of the bug fixes has been written into breaking changes in the client's updates.

Existing neuron-editing mitigation strategies often struggle to handle such situation and most of them lack flexibility and tend to distort feature representations. Motivated by such over-attention phenomenon and software engineering paradigms such as delta debugging and hot patching, we propose AtPatch, a hot-fix method that dynamically redistributes attention maps during model inference. Specifically, for a given input, AtPatch first extracts the attention map from the model's inference process. Then, it uses a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous columns and replace them with unified benign attention. Then, AtPatch rescales other columns to mitigate the impact of over-attention. Finally, AtPatch returns the redistributed attention map to the model for continued inference. Notably, if the detector does not report any anomalous columns, AtPatch directly returns the original attention map to the model. Unlike existing techniques, AtPatch selectively redistributes the attention map, making it better at preserving the model's original functionality. Furthermore, AtPatch's on-the-fly nature allows it to work without modifying model parameters or retraining, making it better suited for deployed models. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AtPatch. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, AtPatch can more effectively mitigate backdoor attacks and unfairness while better preserving the model's original functionality."}

While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier."}

We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread \"False Certification\" of functionally broken code.

Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods.

First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints.

However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability."}

Early efforts applied ARIES-style cost-scaling relations to generate Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) estimates and were calibrated through a pilot study with Bechtel and Decysive Systems to benchmark balance-of-plant (BOP) costs and validate plant-level reasonableness from an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) perspective. Subsequent work, informed by Lucid Catalyst studies of nuclear cost drivers, expanded the methodology to treat indirect costs explicitly and to evaluate cost-reduction pathways for non-fusion-island systems through design-for-cost practices, modularization, centralized manufacturing, and learning. As ARPA-E's fusion portfolio expanded, these methods were applied across BETHE and GAMOW concepts (and select ALPHA revisits), including enhanced treatment of tritium handling and plant integration supported by Princeton/PPPL expertise. In 2023 the capability was refactored to align with the IAEA-GEN-IV EMWG-EPRI code-of-accounts lineage, while key ARIES-derived scaling relations were replaced by bottom-up subsystem models for dominant fusion cost drivers (e.g., magnets, lasers, power supplies, and power-core components) coupled to physics-informed power balances and engineering-constrained radial builds. These developments were implemented in the spreadsheet-based Fusion Economics code (FECONs) and released as an open-source Python framework (pyFECONs), providing a transparent mapping from subsystem estimates to standardized accounts and a consistent computation of LCOE."}

Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains."}

This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark.

DISTINCT carries three iterative components: (1) a Generator that derives initial tests based on the NLDs and the focal method, (2) a Validator that iteratively fixes uncompilable tests using compiler diagnostics, and (3) an Analyzer that iteratively aligns test behavior with NLD semantics via branch-level analysis.Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DISTINCT achieves an average improvement of 14.64% in Compilation Success Rate (CSR) and 6.66% in Passing Rate (PR) across both benchmarks.

We introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported bugs, removing bugs and patches rejected by our policies can raise success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination.

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation."}

Eighty participants (40 software practitioners and 40 software engineering students) completed these two tests with nine interview-style problem solving tasks, comprising six coding-related and three logical-reasoning questions. Our practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy than students, although this difference was not statistically significant. Students achieved higher accuracy on the coding and logical-reasoning tasks.

Conscientiousness was the strongest personality-related association, positively correlated with both grammatical reasoning and problem solving accuracy. Openness to experience was also positively correlated with grammatical reasoning and problem solving accuracy. Neuroticism showed a small negative correlation with problem solving accuracy and weak negative correlation with grammatical reasoning accuracy.

In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by evaluating 100 replication packages published as part of ICSE proceedings over the past decade (2015--2024). We assess the (1) executability of the replication packages, (2) efforts and modifications required to execute them, (3) challenges that prevent executability, and (4) reproducibility of the original findings. We spent approximately 650 person-hours in total executing the artifacts and reproducing the study findings. Our findings reveal that only 40\\% of the 100 evaluated artifacts were executable, of which 32.5\\% (13 out of 40) ran without any modification. Regarding effort levels, 17.5\\% (7 out of 40) required low effort, while 82.5\\% (33 out of 40) required moderate to high effort to execute successfully. We identified five common types of modifications and 13 challenges leading to execution failure, spanning environmental, documentation, and structural issues. Among the executable artifacts, only 35\\% (14 out of 40) reproduced the original results. These findings highlight a notable gap between artifact availability, executability, and reproducibility. Our study proposes three actionable guidelines to improve the preparation, documentation, and review of research artifacts, thereby strengthening the rigor and sustainability of open science practices in SE research."}

Although large language models (LLMs) provide a promising training-free alternative to unsupervised approaches, their effectiveness in aerospace settings remains under-examined because of complex telemetry, misaligned evaluation metrics, and the absence of domain knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce ATSADBench, the first benchmark for aerospace TSAD. ATSADBench comprises nine tasks that combine three pattern-wise anomaly types, univariate and multivariate signals, and both in-loop and out-of-loop feedback scenarios, yielding 108,000 data points. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under two paradigms: Direct, which labels anomalies within sliding windows, and Prediction-Based, which detects anomalies from prediction errors. To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates. These findings offer guidance for future LLM-based TSAD in aerospace software."}

A widely used approach to improve dataset diversity involves generating realistic synthetic traffic scenarios. However, producing such scenarios remains difficult due to the precision required when scripting them manually or generating them in a single pass. Natural language offers a flexible way to describe scenarios, but existing text-to-simulation pipelines often rely on static snippet retrieval, limited grammar, single-pass decoding, or lack robust executability checks. Moreover, they depend heavily on constrained LLM prompting with minimal post-processing. To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE - Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering, a multi-stage tool that converts natural language prompts into executable Scenic scripts through iterative LLM-guided refinement. After each generation, ARISE tests script executability in simulation software, feeding structured diagnostics back to the LLM until both syntactic and functional requirements are met. This process significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Through extensive evaluation, ARISE outperforms the baseline in generating semantically accurate and executable traffic scenarios with greater reliability and robustness."}

However, existing benchmarks suffer from two critical limitations: first, the lack of multi-language support in repository-level contexts, which restricts the generalizability of evaluation results; second, the reliance on noisy, incomplete ground truth derived from raw Pull Request (PR) comments, which constrains the scope of issue detection. To address these challenges, we introduce AACR-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that provides full cross-file context across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional datasets, AACR-Bench employs an \"AI-assisted, Expert-verified\" annotation pipeline to uncover latent defects often overlooked in original PRs, resulting in a 285% increase in defect coverage. Extensive evaluations of mainstream LLMs on AACR-Bench reveal that previous assessments may have either misjudged or only partially captured model capabilities due to data limitations. Our work establishes a more rigorous standard for ACR evaluation and offers new insights on LLM based ACR, i.e., the granularity/level of context and the choice of retrieval methods significantly impact ACR performance, and this influence varies depending on the LLM, programming language, and the LLM usage paradigm e.g., whether an Agent architecture is employed.

However, the computational costs associated with LLM inference, particularly in terms of latency and energy consumption, have received limited attention in the security context. This paper introduces DrainCode, the first adversarial attack targeting the computational efficiency of RAG-based code generation systems. By strategically poisoning retrieval contexts through a mutation-based approach, DrainCode forces LLMs to produce significantly longer outputs, thereby increasing GPU latency and energy consumption. We evaluate the effectiveness of DrainCode across multiple models. Our experiments show that DrainCode achieves up to an 85% increase in latency, a 49% increase in energy consumption, and more than a 3x increase in output length compared to the baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of the attack across different prompting strategies and its effectiveness compared to different defenses. The results highlight DrainCode as a potential method for increasing the computational overhead of LLMs, making it useful for evaluating LLM security in resource-constrained environments. We provide code and data atthis https URL."}

Unlike general-purpose engines such as ONNX Runtime, today's LLM inference systems offer little operator-level visibility, leaving developers blind to where time and resources go. Even basic questions -- is this workload memory-bound or compute-bound? -- often remain unanswered. To close this gap, we develop a fine-grained, non-intrusive profiling framework for modern LLM inference engines, exemplified by llama-cpp but applicable to similar runtime architectures. Built on extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology, our system dynamically attaches probes to runtime functions across multiple layers -- without modifying or recompiling the source. It transforms collected traces into rich visualizations of operators, graphs, timelines, and hardware counter trends, exposing how dense inference, Mixture-of-Experts routing, and operator offloading behave in practice. With less than 4% runtime overhead and high profiling fidelity, our framework makes LLM inference both transparent and diagnosable, turning performance profiling into a practical tool for optimization, scheduling, and resource-aware deployment."}

OSS project maintainers often integrate contributions from external actors. While maintainers can assess the correctness of a pull request, assessing a pull request's cybersecurity implications is challenging. To help maintainers make this decision, we propose that the open-source ecosystem should incorporate Actor Reputation Metrics (ARMS). This capability would enable OSS maintainers to assess a prospective contributor's cybersecurity reputation. To support the future instantiation of ARMS, we identify seven generic security signals from industry standards; map concrete metrics from prior work and available security tools, describe study designs to refine and assess the utility of ARMS, and finally weigh its pros and cons."}
