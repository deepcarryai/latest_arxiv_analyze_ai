Dental age assessment is widely recognized as one of the most reliable biological approaches for adolescents and young adults, but current practices are challenged by methodological heterogeneity, fragmented data representation, and limited interoperability between clinical, forensic, and legal information systems. These limitations hinder transparency and reproducibility, amplified by the increasing adoption of AI- based methods. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is domain-specific and provides a standardized, semantically coherent framework, encompassing both manual and AI-assisted forensic dental age assessment workflows, and enabling traceable linkage between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes. It models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual-level information, forensic examination data, dental developmental assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods. It is being developed together with domain experts, and it builds on upper and established biomedical, dental, and machine learning ontologies, ensuring interoperability, extensibility, and compliance with FAIR principles. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is a fundamental step to enhance consistency, transparency, and explainability, establishing a robust foundation for ontology-driven decision support systems in medico-legal and judicial contexts."}

Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation."}

To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age.

Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work."}

Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves.

Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems."}

We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records."}

We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error. Our results quantify when black-box testing is statistically underdetermined and provide explicit criteria for when additional safeguards -- architectural constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability, and deployment monitoring -- are mathematically necessary for worst-case safety assurance."}

We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise.

However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the \"non-outlier\" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a \"Sanction Score.\" We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds."}

We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant.

This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support."}

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning."}

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches."}

This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task."}

Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements."}

MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension."}

Our framework employs a hypothesis-verification loop to ground model reasoning in real data. In the schema linking phase, we use logical planning to verbalize hypotheses, dual-pathway pruning to reduce the search space, and parallel data profiling to validate column roles against real data, followed by global synthesis to ensure topological connectivity. For SQL generation, we introduce a deterministic mechanism to retrieve exploration directives, allowing the agent to effectively explore data distributions, refine hypotheses, and generate semantically accurate SQLs.

In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on \"triggering cues\": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce \"intent laundering\": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated \"reasonably safe\" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access.

In contrast, the substrate described here represents semantic continuity as a persistent, addressable memory graph evolved under a time-modulated local operator g(t). Work is bounded by local semantic change Delta s, independent of total memory cardinality M.Empirical measurements on Apple M2-class silicon demonstrate invariant traversal latency (approximately 0.25 to 0.32 ms), stable CPU utilization (approximately 17.2 percent baseline with Delta CPU approximately 0 to 0.2 percent), and no scale-correlated thermal signature across 1M to 25M node regimes under sustained operation.

Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses.

We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect."}

We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model.

In each system, truth is defined operationally: held-out labels, the objectively correct option, or the participant's pre-feedback expectation - the only non-circular reference decodable from post-feedback EEG. The gap appeared universally but was regulated differently: dense networks accumulated it as memorization; sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it; humans generated transient over-commitment that was actively recovered. Neural over-commitment (~0.04-0.10) was amplified tenfold into behavioral commitment (d = 3.3-3.9). The gap is a fundamental constraint on learning under noisy supervision; its consequences depend on the regulation each system employs."}

Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores.

Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks. Finally, we show that SimToolReal generalizes across a diverse set of everyday tools, achieving strong zero-shot performance over 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories."}

With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling."}

We present AdaptOrch, a formal framework for task-adaptive multi-agent orchestration that dynamically selects among four canonical topologies (parallel, sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid) based on task dependency graphs and empirically derived domain characteristics. Our framework introduces three key contributions: (1) a Performance Convergence Scaling Law, formalizing conditions under which orchestration selection outweighs model selection; (2) a Topology Routing Algorithm that maps task decomposition DAGs to optimal orchestration patterns in O(|V| + |E|) time; and (3) an Adaptive Synthesis Protocol with provable termination guarantees and heuristic consistency scoring for parallel agent outputs.

In this work, we propose the use of AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, to automatically discover new multiagent learning algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by evolving novel variants for two distinct paradigms of game-theoretic learning. First, in the domain of iterative regret minimization, we evolve the logic governing regret accumulation and policy derivation, discovering a new algorithm, Volatility-Adaptive Discounted (VAD-)CFR. VAD-CFR employs novel, non-intuitive mechanisms-including volatility-sensitive discounting, consistency-enforced optimism, and a hard warm-start policy accumulation schedule-to outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Discounted Predictive CFR+. Second, in the regime of population based training algorithms, we evolve training-time and evaluation-time meta strategy solvers for PSRO, discovering a new variant, Smoothed Hybrid Optimistic Regret (SHOR-)PSRO. SHOR-PSRO introduces a hybrid meta-solver that linearly blends Optimistic Regret Matching with a smoothed, temperature-controlled distribution over best pure strategies.

In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\\pi$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\\Pi(\\pi)$).

Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding.

Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method.

However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments."}

However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.To address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale."}

The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training.

Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity."}

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$."}

Many of these methods compare their results against basic benchmarks or other state-of-the-art DRL agents but often fail to compare their performance against traditional methods used by financial professionals in practical settings.

Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset.

To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy."}

Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains.

To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Value, a novel Cross-lingual Values Assessment Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess deep-level values of content from a global perspective. X-Value consists of more than 5,000 QA pairs across 18 languages, systematically organized into 7 core domains grounded in Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values and categorized into easy and hard levels for discriminative evaluation. We further propose a unique two-stage annotation framework that first identifies whether an issue falls under global consensus (e.g., human rights) or pluralism (e.g., religion), and subsequently conducts a multi-party evaluation of the latent values embedded within the content. Systematic evaluations on X-Value reveal that current SOTA LLMs exhibit deficiencies in cross-lingual values assessment ($Acc < 77\\%$), with significant performance disparities across different languages ($\\Delta Acc > 20\\%$).

Yet, their reliability is increasingly questioned due to sensitivity to shallow variations in input prompts. This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation."}

Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior. These insights suggest that securing embodied AI requires moving beyond component-level defenses toward system-level reasoning about physical risk, uncertainty, and failure propagation."}

In particular, models that achieve high predictive performance may still fail to inspire trust if their key features fluctuate when data completeness changes, undermining reproducibility and downstream decision-making. Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data. By explicitly quantifying robustness to missing data and prioritising interpretable, stable features, CACTUS offers a generalizable framework for trustworthy data-driven decision support."}

This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors.

We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned.

We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered.

To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features.

We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold.

In this thesis, we argue that for embodied agents that deal with open-ended dialog during task assistance: 1) AI Agents should extract goals from conversations in the form of Natural Language (NL) to be better at capturing human preferences as it is intuitive for humans to communicate their preferences on tasks to agents through natural language. 2) AI Agents should quantify/maintain uncertainty about these goals to ensure that actions are being taken according to goals that the agent is extremely certain about. We present an online method for embodied agents to learn and accomplish diverse user goals. While offline methods like RLHF can represent various goals but require large datasets, our approach achieves similar flexibility with online efficiency. We extract natural language goal representations from conversations with Large Language Models (LLMs). We prompt an LLM to role play as a human with different goals and use the corresponding likelihoods to run Bayesian inference over potential goals.

This paper studies such AI-assisted decision-making settings, where the human learns through repeated interactions with the algorithm. In our framework, the algorithm -- designed to maximize decision accuracy according to its own model -- determines which features the human can consider. The human then makes a prediction based on their own less accurate model. We observe that the discrepancy between the algorithm's model and the human's model creates a fundamental tradeoff: Should the algorithm prioritize recommending more informative features, encouraging the human to learn their importance, even if it results in less accurate predictions in the short term until learning occurs? Or is it preferable to forgo educating the human and instead select features that align more closely with their existing understanding, minimizing the immediate cost of learning? Our analysis reveals how this trade-off is shaped by both the algorithm's patience (the time-discount rate of its objective over multiple periods) and the human's willingness and ability to learn. We show that optimal feature selection has a surprisingly clean combinatorial characterization, reducible to a stationary sequence of feature subsets that is tractable to compute.

CaveAgent introduces a dual-stream architecture that inverts the conventional paradigm: rather than treating the LLM's text context as the primary workspace with tools as auxiliary, CaveAgent elevates the persistent Python runtime as the central locus of state, with a lightweight semantic stream serving as its orchestrator. Beyond leveraging code generation to resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, CaveAgent introduces \\textit{Stateful Runtime Management}: it injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns, unlike existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound.

While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning."}

In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs' initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses.

The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary. However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available atthis https URL."}

KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a clipped-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale.

We extend our experiments to 8K context length, and RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip achieves 52% accuracy on AIME25, surpassing the official Qwen3-4B-Instruct model (47%).

Consequently, these benchmarks fail to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) under realistic reporting conditions. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinTagging, the first comprehensive benchmark for structure aware and full scope XBRL tagging. We decompose the complex tagging process into two subtasks: (1) FinNI (Financial Numeric Identification), which extracts entities and types from heterogeneous contexts including text and tables; and (2) FinCL (Financial Concept Linking), which maps extracted entities to the full US GAAP taxonomy.

As these models are rapidly evolving toward general-purpose instruction following across diverse and complex tasks, a key frontier is evaluating their crosslingual and multimodal capabilities over both short- and long-form inputs. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on a single modality at a time, rely on short-form inputs, or lack human annotations--hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first crosslingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks on NLP and beyond. MCIF evaluates instruction following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over different input lengths and spans four macro-tasks: recognition, translation, question answering, and summarization. It covers three core modalities (speech, vision, and text) and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), fully aligned across all dimensions. This parallel design enables a systematic evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and effectively integrate multimodal contextual information. Our benchmarking and analysis of 23 models highlight universal challenges across modalities and tasks, indicating substantial room for improvement in future MLLMs development.

This strategy is computationally efficient but the underlying constraint can be overly rigid for heterogeneous projection weights and may incur avoidable accuracy loss. We propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a training-free framework that replaces low-rank factorization with a structured sparse decomposition in which each weight matrix is represented as a dense dictionary multiplied by a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This yields a union-of-subspaces model: the columns of the weight matrix are represented as linear combinations of different subsets of dictionary atoms, improving expressiveness at a fixed parameter budget. CoSpaDi is calibration-guided: using a small calibration set, we optimize the factorization to minimize functional reconstruction error of layer outputs rather than weight-space error. An activation-derived Gram orthonormalization reformulates this data-aware objective into a standard dictionary learning problem on transformed weights, and we support both per-layer compression and cross-layer dictionary sharing within groups of similar projections. Across Llama and Qwen model families, CoSpaDi consistently improves the accuracy--compression and perplexity--compression trade-offs over state-of-the-art SVD-based baselines and strong structured pruning baselines at 20-40\\% compression ratios.

LRT guidance composes naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL."}

Despite these advancements, recent methods still rely heavily on substantial paired (labeled) feedback data, leading to substantial resource expenditures. To address these challenges, we study the problem of Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) in which the idea is to learn from both a small number of pairwise preference labels and a large pool of unpaired samples simultaneously. Our key theoretical contribution proves the existence of an optimal reward threshold capable of separating winning and losing responses with high probability, which enables a principled pseudo-labeling of unpaired data. By leveraging these pseudo-labels, SSPO effectively distills latent preferences from large-scale unpaired data, thus maintaining human alignment while drastically reducing acquisition costs. Extensive experiments across datasets validate this remarkable data efficiency; for instance, SSPO trained with Mistral-7B-Instruct on just 1% of UltraFeedback consistently surpasses strong baselines trained on 10% of UltraFeedback."}

First, we adopt prompt perplexity as an indicator of model adaptability in learning, enabling the model to progress from well-understood contexts to more challenging ones. Second, we amplify the discrepancy among the rollouts by differentiating their relative entropy, and prioritize sequences that exhibit a higher degree of exploration. Together, these mechanisms reduce rollout demand while preserving competitive performance. On the Qwen and Llama models, PREPO achieves effective results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with up to 3 times fewer rollouts than the baselines.

However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English.

WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities.

However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel \"free-lunch\" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it.

MARS is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity. The N-ball sampling technique samples perturbed samples directly from a desired distribution instead of reweighting, leading to further improvement in the faithfulness.

Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher local surrogate fidelity compared to baseline local explanation methods, with an average reduction of 32% in root mean square error, indicating more accurate local approximations of the black-box model.

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes."}

Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent runtime. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis."}

In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B."}

JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret. JoBS outperforms existing multi-fidelity BO baselines, as well as data and model optimization approaches across diverse LLM tasks under the same optimization budget."}

However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions.

In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across seven LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity).

In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed.

Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $\\alpha$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $\\alpha = 0.10$, SCOPE consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B.

To address these issues, we propose a cellular traffic prediction framework that integrates spatio-temporal modeling with time-frequency analysis.

To address this, we conducted a two-week diary study, where we captured 20 BLV participants' use of an MLLM-enabled visual interpretation application.

To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration--Exploitation Distillation (E$^2$D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E$^2$D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being $18\\times$ faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining $4.3\\times$ faster.

(2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts.

We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability.

In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally.

In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft \"verifiers\". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard. These results highlight the potential of using reference-guided LLM-evaluators to enable effective LLM post-training in non-verifiable domains."}

However, these models demonstrate a training data bias towards a small number of popular languages or rely on transfer learning from high- to under-resourced languages; this may lead to a misrepresentation of social, cultural, and historical aspects. To address this challenge, monolingual LLMs have been developed for under-resourced languages; however, their effectiveness remains less studied when compared to multilingual counterparts on language-specific tasks. In this study, we address this research gap in Greek QA by contributing: (i) DemosQA, a novel dataset, which is constructed using social media user questions and community-reviewed answers to better capture the Greek social and cultural zeitgeist; (ii) a memory-efficient LLM evaluation framework adaptable to diverse QA datasets and languages; and (iii) an extensive evaluation of 11 monolingual and multilingual LLMs on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets using 3 different prompting strategies.

Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality.

However, Meenzerisch is on the verge of dying out-a fate it shares with many other German dialects. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to help with the preservation and revival efforts of languages and dialects. However, so far no NLP research has looked at Meenzerisch. This work presents the first research in the field of NLP that is explicitly focused on the dialect of Mainz. We introduce a digital dictionary-an NLP-ready dataset derived from an existing resource (Schramm, 1966)-to support researchers in modeling and benchmarking the language. It contains 2,351 words in the dialect paired with their meanings described in Standard German. We then use this dataset to answer the following research questions: (1) Can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) generate definitions for dialect words? (2) Can LLMs generate words in Meenzerisch, given their definitions? Our experiments show that LLMs can do neither: the best model for definitions reaches only 6.27% accuracy and the best word generation model's accuracy is 1.51%. We then conduct two additional experiments in order to see if accuracy is improved by few-shot learning and by extracting rules from the training set, which are then passed to the LLM. While those approaches are able to improve the results, accuracy remains below 10%. This highlights that additional resources and an intensification of research efforts focused on German dialects are desperately needed."}

The conceptual framework combines AES encryption for classical security, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange with eavesdropping detection, quantum state comparison for lightweight authentication, and a bio-inspired immune system for adaptive threat detection. RSA is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, BB84 achieves full key agreement in ideal conditions, and it detects eavesdropping with high accuracy.

Rather than focusing on error prevention, this work focuses on error recovery, which necessitates the accurate diagnosis of erroneous dialogue contexts and execution of proper recovery plans. Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts."}

However, theoretical work in the field suggests that first-personal interaction is a crucial part of ToM and that such predictive, spectatorial tasks may fail to evaluate it. We address this gap with a novel ToM task that requires an agent to persuade a target to choose one of three policy proposals by strategically revealing information. Success depends on a persuader's sensitivity to a given target's knowledge states (what the target knows about the policies) and motivational states (how much the target values different outcomes). We varied whether these states were Revealed to persuaders or Hidden, in which case persuaders had to inquire about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants persuaded a bot programmed to make only rational inferences. LLMs excelled in the Revealed condition but performed below chance in the Hidden condition, suggesting difficulty with the multi-step planning required to elicit and use mental state information. Humans performed moderately well in both conditions, indicating an ability to engage such planning. In Experiment 2, where a human target role-played the bot, and in Experiment 3, where we measured whether human targets' real beliefs changed, LLMs outperformed human persuaders across all conditions. These results suggest that effective persuasion can occur without explicit ToM reasoning (e.g., through rhetorical strategies) and that LLMs excel at this form of persuasion. Overall, our results caution against attributing human-like ToM to LLMs while highlighting LLMs' potential to influence people's beliefs and behavior."}

Systematic evaluations on X-Value reveal that current SOTA LLMs exhibit deficiencies in cross-lingual values assessment ($Acc < 77\\%$), with significant performance disparities across different languages ($\\Delta Acc > 20\\%$). This work highlights the urgent need to improve the nuanced, values-aware content assessment capability of LLMs. Our X-Value is available at:this https URL."}

A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization."}

This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation."}

Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline.

Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost.

In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on \"triggering cues\": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce \"intent laundering\": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated \"reasonably safe\" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access. Overall, our findings expose a significant disconnect between how model safety is evaluated and how real-world adversaries behave."}

In this paper, we describe how distribution shifts in language models can be separated into observable and unobservable components, and we discuss how established approaches for dealing with distribution shift address only the former. Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available."}

In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally. Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction. Using DCC, we evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of various leading LLMs across a range of reasoning tasks and interventions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DCC as a training-free test-time rejection sampling criterion and show that it can directly improve performance on reasoning tasks across multiple model families."}

While sliding-window cache strategies can bound memory, they disrupt long-context reasoning and degrade performance. We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference. Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints."}

In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records."}

In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels."}

We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity."}

When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline.

We audit PD across eight LLMs (3 open-source; 5 API-based, including GPT-4o), introduce LMP2 (Language Model Privacy Probe), a human-centered, privacy-preserving audit tool refined through two formative studies (N=20), and run two studies with EU residents to capture (i) intuitions about LLM-generated PD (N1=155) and (ii) reactions to tool output (N2=303). We show empirically that models confidently generate multiple PD categories for well-known individuals. For everyday users, GPT-4o generates 11 features with 60% or more accuracy (e.g., gender, hair color, languages).

A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \\approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \\approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \\approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis."}

To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability.

While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

Many recent research works have attempted to provide a reduction from the $O(n^2)$ time complexity of attention to semi-linear complexity. However, it remains an unsolved problem in the sense of maintaining high performance when complexity is reduced. One of the important works in this respect is the Perceiver class of architectures that have demonstrated excellent performance, while reducing the computation complexity. In this paper, we use the PerceiverAR as a basis and explore the design space of different trade-offs between preserving context and reducing attention complexity. To this end, we develop four new architectural paradigms, the best performing of which we denote as the Efficient Context propagating Perceiver (ECP). ECP has two major advantages over the PerceiverAR. First, the ECP architecture overcomes the main drawback of PercieverAR by utilizing both the context and the latent sequences in autoregressive training. Second, the ECP architecture operates with the same attention complexity as LongLoRA, making it computationally efficient. More importantly, via pairwise segment attention, it extracts better information resulting in improved language modeling. Empirically, we demonstrate that the ECP architecture significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art Transformer models on Wikitext-103, PG-19 and sCIFAR-10."}

Consequently, these benchmarks fail to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) under realistic reporting conditions. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinTagging, the first comprehensive benchmark for structure aware and full scope XBRL tagging.

This two stage formulation enables a fair assessment of LLMs' capabilities in numerical reasoning and taxonomy alignment.

This study introduces DistillNote, an evaluation framework for LLM summaries that targets their functional utility by applying the generated summary downstream in a complex clinical prediction task, explicitly quantifying how much prediction signal is retained. We generated over 192,000 LLM summaries from MIMIC-IV clinical notes with increasing compression rates: standard, section-wise, and distilled section-wise. Heart failure diagnosis was chosen as the prediction task, as it requires integrating a wide range of clinical signals. LLMs were fine-tuned on both the original notes and their summaries, and their diagnostic performance was compared using the AUROC metric. We contrasted DistillNote's results with evaluations from LLM-as-judge and clinicians, assessing consistency across different evaluation methods. Summaries generated by LLMs maintained a strong level of heart failure diagnostic signal despite substantial compression. Models trained on the most condensed summaries (about 20 times smaller) achieved an AUROC of 0.92, compared to 0.94 with the original note baseline (97 percent retention). Functional evaluation provided a new lens for medical summary assessment, emphasizing clinical utility as a key dimension of quality. DistillNote introduces a new scalable, task-based method for assessing the functional utility of LLM-generated clinical summaries.

However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on a single modality at a time, rely on short-form inputs, or lack human annotations--hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first crosslingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks on NLP and beyond. MCIF evaluates instruction following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over different input lengths and spans four macro-tasks: recognition, translation, question answering, and summarization.

Concretely, our released Turkish vocabulary contains 22,231 root tokens mapped to 20,000 canonical root identifiers (with leading spaces to mark word boundaries), 72 affix identifiers that cover 177 allomorphic surface forms, and 12,696 subword units; an orthographic case token preserves capitalization without inflating the vocabulary. We evaluate tokenization quality on the TR-MMLU dataset using two linguistic alignment metrics: Turkish Token Percentage (TR~\\%), the proportion of produced tokens that correspond to Turkish lexical/morphemic units under our lexical resources, and Pure Token Percentage (Pure~\\%), the proportion of tokens aligning with unambiguous root/affix boundaries.

We propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a training-free framework that replaces low-rank factorization with a structured sparse decomposition in which each weight matrix is represented as a dense dictionary multiplied by a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This yields a union-of-subspaces model: the columns of the weight matrix are represented as linear combinations of different subsets of dictionary atoms, improving expressiveness at a fixed parameter budget. CoSpaDi is calibration-guided: using a small calibration set, we optimize the factorization to minimize functional reconstruction error of layer outputs rather than weight-space error. An activation-derived Gram orthonormalization reformulates this data-aware objective into a standard dictionary learning problem on transformed weights, and we support both per-layer compression and cross-layer dictionary sharing within groups of similar projections. Across Llama and Qwen model families, CoSpaDi consistently improves the accuracy--compression and perplexity--compression trade-offs over state-of-the-art SVD-based baselines and strong structured pruning baselines at 20-40\\% compression ratios.

RL is a particularly well-suited paradigm for this task, as it can directly optimize the non-differentiable Spearman ranking metric and guide the reasoning process required by C-STS. Nevertheless, we find that naively applying listwise RL fails to produce meaningful improvements, as the model struggles with complex, coarse-grained reward signals, leading to optimization difficulties. To address this challenge, we introduce PoLi-RL, a novel Point-to-List Reinforcement Learning framework. PoLi-RL employs a two-stage curriculum: it first trains the model with a simple pointwise reward to establish fundamental scoring capabilities, then transitions to a hybrid reward that combines pointwise, pairwise, and listwise objectives to refine the model's ability to discern subtle semantic distinctions. Crucially, we propose an innovative Parallel Slice Ranking Reward (PSRR) mechanism that computes ranking rewards in parallel slices, where each slice consists of completions with the same index from different samples. This provides a precise, differentiated learning signal for each individual completion, enabling granular credit assignment and effective optimization. On the official C-STS benchmark, PoLi-RL achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 48.18, establishing a new SOTA for the cross-encoder architecture.

With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English. However, we also point out key drawbacks of LLMs, including less predictable outputs, significantly slower inference, and higher computational costs. Due to these limitations, fine-tuned BERT-like models remain a more practical choice for large-scale automatic text annotation."}

Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity.

Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $\\alpha$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score.

In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally.

Current evaluation practices for open-ended text responses heavily rely on human experts. This approach introduces human factors and is often cost-prohibitive, labor-intensive, and hinders scalability, especially in complex domains like healthcare where response assessment necessitates domain expertise and considers multifaceted patient data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Precise Boolean rubrics: an evaluation framework that streamlines human and automated evaluation of open-ended questions by identifying gaps in model responses using a minimal set of targeted rubrics questions. Our approach is based on recent work in more general evaluation settings that contrasts a smaller set of complex evaluation targets with a larger set of more precise, granular targets answerable with simple boolean responses. We validate this approach in metabolic health, a domain encompassing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Our results demonstrate that Adaptive Precise Boolean rubrics yield higher inter-rater agreement among expert and non-expert human evaluators, and in automated assessments, compared to traditional Likert scales, while requiring approximately half the evaluation time of Likert-based methods.

We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view.

For site navigation, the system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating form-interaction testing.

Developing critical thinking skills through timely assessment and feedback is crucial; however, there has not been extensive work in educational data mining on defining, measuring, and supporting critical thinking. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of measuring \"subskills\" that underlie critical thinking. We ground our work in an authentic task where students operationalize critical thinking by writing argumentative essays. We developed a coding rubric based on an established skills progression and completed human coding for a corpus of student essays. We then evaluated three distinct approaches to automated scoring: zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and supervised fine-tuning, implemented across three large language models (GPT-5, Llama 3.1 8B, and ModernBERT). Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B achieved the best results and demonstrated particular strength on subskills with highly separable proficiency levels with balanced labels across levels, while lower performance was observed for subskills that required detection of subtle distinctions between proficiency levels or imbalanced labels. Our exploratory work represents an initial step toward scalable assessment of critical thinking skills across authentic educational contexts. Future research should continue to combine automated critical thinking assessment with human validation to more accurately detect and measure dynamic, higher-order thinking skills."}

We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). Soft Symbolic Control constitutes a dedicated governance layer within SCL, applying symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference while preserving the flexibility of neural reasoning and restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability.

In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner.

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines."}

However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows."}

Despite this practical importance, explicit port labels are rare in public surgical datasets, and existing annotations often violate geometric consistency by masking the central lumen (opening), even when anatomical regions are visible through it. We present Cholec80-port, a high-fidelity trocar port segmentation dataset derived from Cholec80, together with a rigorous standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines a port-sleeve mask excluding the central opening. We additionally cleanse and unify existing public datasets under the same SOP.

Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet.

To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy."}

These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points.

However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. Source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance."}

Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment."}

We present \\textbf{HiMAP}, a tracking-free, trajectory prediction framework that remains reliable under MOT failures.

U-Net and U-Net++ architectures were thus employed as lightweight convolutional decoders to assess how well the geospatial information distilled in the embeddings can be translated into accurate surface height estimates. Both architectures achieved strong training performance (both with $R^2 = 0.97$), confirming that the embeddings encode informative and decodable height-related signals. On the test set, performance decreased due to distribution shifts in height frequency between training and testing areas. Nevertheless, U-Net++ shows better generalization ($R^2 = 0.84$, median difference = -2.62 m) compared with the standard U-Net ($R^2 = 0.78$, median difference = -7.22 m), suggesting enhanced robustness to distribution mismatch.

At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons.

This undermines the model's ability to learn robust, generalizable features and results in poor performance on real-world data.

Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines."}

By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can potentially generate fine-grained, language-based analyses, yet existing methods often require costly fine-tuning and do not consistently improve anomaly detection accuracy compared to lightweight specialist detectors. We propose expert-augmented attention guidance for industrial anomaly detection in MLLMs (EAGLE), a tuning-free framework that integrates outputs from expert model to guide MLLMs toward both accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions. We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA show that EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without any parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods.

Recent state-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural representations or 3D Gaussian splatting have made notable progress. However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion. To overcome unreliable initialization without stereo depth or accurate structure-from-motion, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy integrating multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors, providing a robust foundation for optimization. We further incorporate long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors to improve deformation plausibility. Experiments on three public endoscopic datasets with deformable scenes and varying camera motions show that Local-EndoGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key designs. Code will be released upon acceptance at:this https URL."}

We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations.

A promising direction is to use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable MLLMs to reason about and execute optimal tool-use plans within professional image-editing software. However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control. To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems.

However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice.

Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution.

CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate our design choices."}

Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that human-level 3D perception can emerge from a simple, scalable learning objective over naturalistic visual-spatial data.

When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $\\pi_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model.

Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity."}

This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects.

In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation."}

We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance.

While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

However, the unique structure of such data presents new challenges for existing model architectures, which were originally designed for 2D slices or single 3D scans. To address this, we introduce a novel hierarchical attention mechanism inspired by the intrinsic hierarchy of radiology data: slice, scan, and study. We denote our framework as Hierarchical attention for Language-Image Pre-training (HLIP). Trained on 220K studies with 3.13 million scans for brain MRI and 240K studies with 1.44 million scans for head CT, HLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., +10.5% balanced ACC on the proposed publicly available brain MRI benchmark Pub-Brain-5; +8.3% and +1.7% macro AUC on head CT benchmarks CQ500 and RSNA, respectively. HLIP also exhibits strong generalizability on existing 3D medical language-image pre-training benchmarks, e.g., +4.3% macro AUC on the Rad-ChestCT benchmark when pre-trained on CT-RATE.

Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion, a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of motion fidelity than previous work."}

However, this paradigm is hindered by representation misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or 3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective. This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and +6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding."}

Community science platforms such as iNaturalist contain hundreds of millions of biodiversity images, which often contain evidence of these complex phenomena.

We introduce INQUIRE-Search, an open-source system that uses natural language to enable scientists to rapidly search within an ecological image database like iNaturalist for specific phenomena, verify and export relevant observations, and use these outputs for downstream scientific analysis. Across five illustrative case studies, INQUIRE-Search concentrates relevant observations 3-25x more efficiently than comparable manual inspection budgets. These examples demonstrate how the system can be used for ecological inference, from analyzing seasonal variation in behavior across species to forest regrowth after wildfires. These examples illustrate a new paradigm for interactive, efficient, and scalable scientific discovery that can begin to unlock previously inaccessible scientific value in large-scale biodiversity datasets. Finally, we highlight how AI-enabled discovery tools for science require reframing aspects of the scientific process, including experiment design, data collection, survey effort, and uncertainty analysis."}

To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment.

However, current approaches often struggle to model intra- and inter-modal interactions efficiently and effectively due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the inputs. A major challenge is capturing critical prognostic events that, though few, underlie the complexity of the observed inputs and largely determine patient outcomes. These events, manifested as high-level structural signals such as spatial histologic patterns or pathway co-activations, are typically sparse, patient-specific, and unannotated, making them inherently difficult to uncover. To address this, we propose SlotSPE, a slot-based framework for structural prognostic event modeling. Specifically, inspired by the principle of factorial coding, we compress each patient's multimodal inputs into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots using slot attention. By leveraging these slot representations as encodings for prognostic events, our framework enables both efficient and effective modeling of complex intra- and inter-modal interactions, while also facilitating seamless incorporation of biological priors that enhance prognostic relevance. Extensive experiments on ten cancer benchmarks show that SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cohorts, achieving an overall improvement of 2.9%.

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes."}

Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent runtime. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis."}

Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones.

However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths.

Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior.

To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration--Exploitation Distillation (E$^2$D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence.

However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability. To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales. Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware.

This necessitates an effective post-training strategy that introduces minimal yet functional modifications. To address this challenge, we first introduce a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning module 'Learn and Calibrate', or LuCA, designed to acquire task-specific knowledge through an adapter-calibrator couple, enabling well-refined feature representations. Then, for each task, we deploy a sparse LuCA module on top of the last classification token [CLS] just before the classifier, which we refer to as 'Token-level Sparse Calibration and Adaptation', or TOSCA.

The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary. However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples.

However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on a single modality at a time, rely on short-form inputs, or lack human annotations--hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first crosslingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks on NLP and beyond. MCIF evaluates instruction following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over different input lengths and spans four macro-tasks: recognition, translation, question answering, and summarization.

Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities."}

Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions."}

To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that does not depend on post-crash features. A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models.

Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation.

We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect."}

We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides. The learned models predict the argument of latitude error as a Gaussian distribution given parameters from a single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. We show that this one-dimensional model captures the effect of mismodeled drag, which can be mapped to the Cartesian state space.

Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift.

In this work, we leverage recent advances in neural network verification to propose a suite of automated algorithms that yield circuits with *provable guarantees*. We focus on three types of guarantees: (1) *input domain robustness*, ensuring the circuit agrees with the model across a continuous input region; (2) *robust patching*, certifying circuit alignment under continuous patching perturbations; and (3) *minimality*, formalizing and capturing a wide array of various notions of succinctness. Interestingly, we uncover a diverse set of novel theoretical connections among these three families of guarantees, with critical implications for the convergence of our algorithms. Finally, we conduct experiments with state-of-the-art verifiers on various vision models, showing that our algorithms yield circuits with substantially stronger robustness guarantees than standard circuit discovery methods, establishing a principled foundation for provable circuit discovery."}

In each system, truth is defined operationally: held-out labels, the objectively correct option, or the participant's pre-feedback expectation - the only non-circular reference decodable from post-feedback EEG. The gap appeared universally but was regulated differently: dense networks accumulated it as memorization; sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it; humans generated transient over-commitment that was actively recovered.

Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores. Across held-out chess puzzles and full-game play measured by average centipawn loss (ACPL), VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong baselines, highlighting verbalized masking as a practical mechanism for controllable exploration in LLM RL post-training."}

We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference.

An Exact Analysis for the Data-driven Newsvendor", "abstract": "We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand. Our results show that policies based on this sales-as-demand heuristic can suffer severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates, highlighting how the quality of point-of-sale information critically shapes what can, and cannot, be learned offline."}

Our work provides a full mechanistic interpretation of the learned model and a theoretical explanation of its training dynamics. While prior work has identified that individual neurons learn single-frequency Fourier features and phase alignment, it does not fully explain how these features combine into a global solution. We bridge this gap by formalizing a diversification condition that emerges during training when overparametrized, consisting of two parts: phase symmetry and frequency diversification. We prove that these properties allow the network to collectively approximate a flawed indicator function on the correct logic for the modular addition task. While individual neurons produce noisy signals, the phase symmetry enables a majority-voting scheme that cancels out noise, allowing the network to robustly identify the correct sum. Furthermore, we explain the emergence of these features under random initialization via a lottery ticket mechanism. Our gradient flow analysis proves that frequencies compete within each neuron, with the \"winner\" determined by its initial spectral magnitude and phase alignment. From a technical standpoint, we provide a rigorous characterization of the layer-wise phase coupling dynamics and formalize the competitive landscape using the ODE comparison lemma.

With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling."}

Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703.

In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\\pi$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\\Pi(\\pi)$).

Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding.

In this work, we firstly present a systematic evaluation of verification strategies across model families, tasks, and sampling regimes, and find that Traversal Verification dominates consistently, with OT-based methods lagging far behind. Our analysis uncovers that this occurs because OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near the root of the draft tree, while multi-token gains are most impactful deeper in the draft tree, where draft and target distributions diverge.

However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines."}

In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments."}

With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies. By retiring obsolete IDs and resetting reassigned slots, MPZCH prevents the stale embedding inheritance typical of hash-based methods, ensuring new features learn effectively from scratch.

Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity."}

We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure.

However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning."}

By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data."}

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$."}

To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency.

Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Turán-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four.

Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization.

A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \\approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \\approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \\approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis."}

A key approach for obtaining explanations with provable guarantees is by identifying a cardinally-minimal subset of input features which by itself is provably sufficient to determine the prediction. However, for standard neural networks, this task is often computationally infeasible, as it demands a worst-case exponential number of verification queries in the number of input features, each of which is NP-hard.In this work, we show that for Neural Additive Models (NAMs), a recent and more interpretable neural network family, we can efficiently generate explanations with such guarantees. We present a new model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only a logarithmic number of verification queriesin the number of input features, after a parallelized preprocessing step with logarithmic runtime in the required precision is applied to each small univariate NAM component.Our algorithm not only makes the task of obtaining cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, but even outperforms existing algorithms designed to find the relaxed variant of subset-minimal explanations - which may be larger and less informative but easier to compute - despite our algorithm solving a much more difficult task.Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous algorithms, our approach provides provably smaller explanations than existing works and substantially reduces the computation time. Moreover, we show that our generated provable explanations offer benefits that are unattainable by standard sampling-based techniques typically used to interpret NAMs."}

We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks.

We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture.

However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches.

We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling.

But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\\widetilde{f},\\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\\top Q = I$ such that $\\widetilde{f}(x)\\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\\widetilde{g}(y)\\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\\langle f(x), g(y)\\rangle \\approx \\langle \\widetilde{f}(x), \\widetilde{g}(y)\\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models.

In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process.

Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization.

U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model.

This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations.

SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization.

To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms.

We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack.

In this paper, we propose an efficient and widely deployable remote KV cache reuse solution that leverages GPU-native video codecs. Our system, KVFetcher, enables effective KV cache coding with two techniques. The codec-friendly tensor layout compresses the KV cache in a highly compact video format, enabling fast transmission. The efficient KV fetcher orchestrates the transmission, decoding, and restoration of compressed KV caches in an efficient pipelined manner, eliminating resource contention, masking network fluctuations, and achieving minimum time-to-first-token (TTFT).

To retain its energy efficiency, analog PUM architectures augment memory arrays with CMOS-based domain-specific fixed-function hardware to provide complete kernel functionality, but the difficulty of integrating such specialized CMOS logic with memory arrays has largely limited analog PUM to being an accelerator for machine learning inference, or for closely related kernels. An opportunity exists to harness analog PUM for general-purpose computation: recent works have shown that memory arrays can also perform Boolean PUM operations, albeit with very different supporting hardware and electrical signals than analog PUM.We propose DARTH-PUM, a general-purpose hybrid PUM architecture that tackles key hardware and software challenges to integrating analog PUM and digital PUM.

In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on \"triggering cues\": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce \"intent laundering\": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated \"reasonably safe\" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access. Overall, our findings expose a significant disconnect between how model safety is evaluated and how real-world adversaries behave."}

We introduce SEMAS, a self-evolving hierarchical multi-agent system that distributes specialized agents across Edge, Fog, and Cloud computational tiers. Edge agents perform lightweight feature extraction and pre-filtering; Fog agents execute diversified ensemble detection with dynamic consensus voting; and Cloud agents continuously optimize system policies via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) while maintaining asynchronous, non-blocking inference.

This architecture enables resource-aware specialization without sacrificing real-time performance or model interpretability. Empirical evaluation on two industrial benchmarks (Boiler Emulator and Wind Turbine) demonstrates that SEMAS achieves superior anomaly detection performance with exceptional stability under adaptation, sustains prediction accuracy across evolving operational contexts, and delivers substantial latency improvements enabling genuine real-time deployment.

Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero).

More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total).

We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives.

We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched.

First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model.

Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work."}

Using an advanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework, this project provides a robust and interpretable tool to estimate the causal impact of different formations on key match outcomes such as goal difference, possession, corners, and disciplinary actions. Leveraging a dataset of over 22,000 matches from top European leagues, formations were categorized into six representative types based on tactical structure and expert consultation. A major methodological contribution lies in the adaptation of DML to handle categorical treatments, specifically formation combinations, through a novel matrix-based residualization process, allowing for a detailed estimation of formation-versus-formation effects that can inform a coach's tactical decision-making. Results show that while offensive formations like 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 offer modest statistical advantages in possession and corners, their impact on goals is limited. Furthermore, no evidence supports the idea that defensive formations, commonly associated with parking the bus, increase a team's winning potential. Additionally, red cards appear unaffected by formation choice, suggesting other behavioral factors dominate. Although this approach does not fully capture all aspects of playing style or team strength, it provides a valuable framework for coaches to analyze tactical efficiency and sets a precedent for future research in sports analytics."}

Safety intervention mechanisms such as circuit breakers reduce unsafe outputs without modifying model weights, but do not directly shape or preserve the internal representations that govern safety behavior. These limitations hinder rapid and reliable safety updates, particularly in settings where models evolve frequently or must adapt to new policies and domains.We present NeST, a lightweight, structure-aware safety alignment framework that strengthens refusal behavior by selectively adapting a small subset of safety-relevant neurons while freezing the remainder of the model. NeST aligns parameter updates with the internal organization of safety behavior by clustering functionally coherent safety neurons and enforcing shared updates within each cluster, enabling targeted and stable safety adaptation without broad model modification or inference-time overhead. We benchmark NeST against three dominant baselines: full fine-tuning, LoRA-based fine-tuning, and circuit breakers across 10 open-weight LLMs spanning multiple model families and sizes. Across all evaluated models, NeST reduces the attack success rate from an average of 44.5% to 4.36%, corresponding to a 90.2% reduction in unsafe generations, while requiring only 0.44 million trainable parameters on average.

There, the transformer architecture, which has been highly successful in language and vision applications, allows us to account for the fact that the most recently observed time points in an individual's history may not always be the most important for the immediate future. This is achieved by assigning attention weights to observations of an individual based on a transformation of their values. One reason why these ideas have not yet been fully leveraged for longitudinal cohort data is that typically, large datasets are required. Therefore, we present a simplified transformer architecture that retains the core attention mechanism while reducing the number of parameters to be estimated, to be more suitable for small datasets with few time points. Guided by a statistical perspective on transformers, we use an autoregressive model as a starting point and incorporate attention as a kernel-based operation with temporal decay, where aggregation of multiple transformer heads, i.e. different candidate weighting schemes, is expressed as accumulating evidence on different types of underlying characteristics of individuals. This also enables a permutation-based statistical testing procedure for identifying contextual patterns. In a simulation study, the approach is shown to recover contextual dependencies even with a small number of individuals and time points. In an application to data from a resilience study, we identify temporal patterns in the dynamics of stress and mental health.

This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a \"Safety Gap\" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications. These results suggest that modeling the sequential evolution of intent is a more effective and computationally efficient alternative to deploying massive, stateless models."}

Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems."}

Based on a verification algorithm involving target and draft model probabilities, a prefix of the candidate sequence is accepted, and an additional correction token is sampled from a residual distribution to ensure that the final output adheres to the target distribution. While standard speculative decoding uses a verification algorithm which is independent at each token on the path, a recent extension called block verification uses a joint condition involving all sampled on-path probabilities. Block verification (BV) was shown to be optimal over all verification algorithms which use only on-path probabilities, improving on standard speculative decoding. In this work, we first show that block verification is optimal even over verification algorithms that use off-path probabilities, by constructing an information-agnostic linear program (LP). Further, we can extend our LP to the setting where the draft model samples multiple candidate paths, and use it to construct a natural class of multi-path block verification generalizations. While computing the optimal algorithm in this class is not tractable, by considering a stricter class of greedy algorithms, we can formulate an efficient method called greedy multi-path block verification (GBV). Empirically, GBV can improve block efficiency by over 30% and reduce decoding walltimes by over 15% relative to BV.

In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records."}

PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available.

The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training.

We first provide a complete dynamic classification of posterior evolution in a misspecified two-armed Gaussian bandit, identifying distinct regimes: correct model concentration, incorrect model concentration, and persistent belief mixing, characterized by the direction of statistical evidence and the model-action mapping. These regimes yield sharp predictions for limiting beliefs, action frequencies, and asymptotic regret.

This approach characterizes two sufficient conditions to classify the ergodic and transient behaviors and provides inductive dimensional reductions of the posterior dynamics. Our results offer the first qualitative and geometric classification of TS under misspecification, bridging Bayesian learning with evolutionary dynamics, and also build the foundations of robust decision-making in structured bandits."}

For least-squares estimation over GNNs with linear graph convolutions and a deep ReLU readout, we prove a sharp non-asymptotic risk bound that separates approximation, stochastic, and optimization errors. The bound makes explicit how performance scales with the fraction of labeled nodes and graph-induced dependence. Approximation guarantees are further derived for graph-smoothing followed by smooth nonlinear readouts, yielding convergence rates that recover classical nonparametric behavior under full supervision while characterizing performance when labels are scarce.

Under this structure, environment perturbations that affect the covariates do not propagate to the outcome, which motivates regularizing the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. Crucially, estimating these perturbation directions does not require labels, enabling us to leverage unlabeled data from multiple environments.

Existing tools to verify inference typically rely on methods from cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but these add significant computational overhead, and remain infeasible for use for large models.

Specifically, we propose two new protocols which leverage privacy-preserving LLM inference in order to provide guarantees over the inference that was carried out. Our approaches are cheap, requiring the addition of a few extra tokens of computation, and have little to no downstream impact. As the fastest privacy-preserving inference methods are typically faster than ZK methods, the proposed protocols also improve verification runtime.

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning."}

Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost.

Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility."}

Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network.

We extend our algorithms to the setting in which the leader's utility function is unknown, and also apply it to the problems of bidding in second-price auctions with side information and online Bayesian persuasion with public and private states. Finally, we observe that our algorithms empirically outperform previous results on numerical simulations."}

Blasingame,Chen Liu", "title": "Rex: A Family of Reversible Exponential (Stochastic) Runge-Kutta Solvers", "abstract": "Deep generative models based on neural differential equations have quickly become the state-of-the-art for numerous generation tasks across many different applications. These models rely on ODE/SDE solvers which integrate from a prior distribution to the data distribution. In many applications it is highly desirable to then integrate in the other direction. The standard solvers, however, accumulate discretization errors which don't align with the forward trajectory, thereby prohibiting an exact inversion. In applications where the precision of the generative model is paramount this inaccuracy in inversion is often unacceptable. Current approaches to solving the inversion of these models results in significant downstream issues with poor stability and low-order of convergence; moreover, they are strictly limited to the ODE domain. In this work, we propose a new family of reversible exponential (stochastic) Runge-Kutta solvers which we refer to as Rex developed by an application of Lawson methods to convert any explicit (stochastic) Runge-Kutta scheme into a reversible one. In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed solvers, we also empirically demonstrate the utility of Rex on improving the sampling of Boltzmann distributions with flow models, and improving image generation and editing capabilities with diffusion models."}

This necessitates an effective post-training strategy that introduces minimal yet functional modifications. To address this challenge, we first introduce a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning module 'Learn and Calibrate', or LuCA, designed to acquire task-specific knowledge through an adapter-calibrator couple, enabling well-refined feature representations. Then, for each task, we deploy a sparse LuCA module on top of the last classification token [CLS] just before the classifier, which we refer to as 'Token-level Sparse Calibration and Adaptation', or TOSCA. By leaving the generalization capabilities of the foundation models intact and adapting exclusively via the last token, our approach achieves a harmonious balance between stability and plasticity while reducing both training and inference complexity. We demonstrate that TOSCA yields state-of-the-art performance while introducing ~8 times fewer parameters compared to prior methods."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose efficient Orthogonal Fine-Tuning with Principal Subspace adaptation (PSOFT), which confines orthogonal transformations to the principal subspace of pre-trained weights. Specifically, PSOFT constructs this subspace via matrix decomposition to enable compatible transformations with higher effective rank, establishes a theoretical condition that strictly maintains the geometry of this subspace for essential semantic preservation, and introduces efficient tunable vectors that gradually relax orthogonality during training to enhance adaptability. Extensive experiments on 35 NLP and CV tasks across four representative models demonstrate that PSOFT offers a practical and scalable solution to simultaneously achieve semantic preservation, expressiveness, and multi-dimensional efficiency in PEFT.

KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a clipped-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO.

This concern has contributed to a broader trend in graph representation learning toward augmentation-free methods, which view such structural changes as problematic and should be avoided. However, this trend overlooks the fundamental insight that structural changes from biologically meaningful perturbations are not a problem to be avoided, but rather a rich source of information, thereby ignoring the valuable opportunity to leverage data from real biological experiments. Motivated by this insight, we propose SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a new GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision. SupGCL is a probabilistic formulation that continuously generalizes conventional GCL, linking artificial augmentations with real perturbations measured in knockdown experiments, and using the latter as explicit supervision. On patient-derived GRNs from three cancer types, we train GRN representations with SupGCL and evaluate it in two regimes: (i) embedding space analysis, where it yields clearer disease-subtype structure and improves clustering, and (ii) task-specific fine-tuning, where it consistently outperforms strong graph representation learning baselines on 13 downstream tasks spanning gene-level functional annotation and patient-level prediction."}

In contrast, our method dynamically allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling significant gains in sample efficiency.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex priors or higher accuracy requirements.

Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo.

For this purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional $L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures.

To detect and prevent overthinking, we propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal, Entropy After </Think> (EAT), for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token usage by 12 - 22% without harming accuracy.

To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($\\pi$-Flow). $\\pi$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep. The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the policy's trajectory using a standard $\\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming previous 1-NFE models of the same DiT architecture.

Notions such as disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness (balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm. Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet, Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as much balance."}

On the other hand, their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory (SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times. Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and 1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone)."}

We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget. Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL."}

Our key theoretical contribution proves the existence of an optimal reward threshold capable of separating winning and losing responses with high probability, which enables a principled pseudo-labeling of unpaired data.

This paper proposes a novel local model agnostic explanation method to generate high-fidelity explanations using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and N-ball sampling strategies. MARS is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity. The N-ball sampling technique samples perturbed samples directly from a desired distribution instead of reweighting, leading to further improvement in the faithfulness. The performance of the proposed method was computed in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and evaluated on five different benchmark datasets with different kernel width. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher local surrogate fidelity compared to baseline local explanation methods, with an average reduction of 32% in root mean square error, indicating more accurate local approximations of the black-box model. Additionally, statistical analysis shows that across all benchmark datasets, the proposed approach results were statistically significantly better.

Most existing DR-RL approaches, however, rely on strong data availability assumptions, such as access to a generative model or large offline datasets, and are largely restricted to tabular settings.In this work, we propose a fully online DR-RL algorithm with general function approximation that learns robust policies solely through interaction, without requiring prior knowledge or pre-collected data. Our approach is based on a dual-driven fitted robust Bellman procedure that simultaneously estimates the value function and the corresponding worst-case backup operator. We establish regret guarantees for online DR-RL characterized by an intrinsic complexity notion, the robust Bellman-Eluder dimension, covering a broad class of phi-divergence uncertainty sets. The resulting regret bounds are sublinear, do not scale with the size of the state or action spaces, and specialize to tight rates in structured problem classes, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of our framework."}

In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner.

Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide a theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results of the reconstruction error under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior."}

To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand.

To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data."}

Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions.

These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.

We introduce JoBS, an approach that uses a scaling-law-inspired performance predictor to aid Bayesian optimization (BO) in jointly optimizing LLM training data and model configurations efficiently. JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret.

In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across seven LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality).

We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts.

In this sequential problem, at each time step, two traders arrive with secret valuations about an asset they wish to trade. The learner (a broker) suggests a trading (or brokerage) price based on contextual data about the asset and the market conditions. Then, the traders reveal their willingness to buy or sell based on whether their valuations are higher or lower than the brokerage price. A trade occurs if one of the two traders decides to buy and the other to sell, i.e., if the broker's proposed price falls between the smallest and the largest of their two valuations. We design algorithms for this problem and prove optimal theoretical regret guarantees under various standard assumptions."}

Prior asymptotic analyses in the proportional high-dimensional regime show that, under isotropic data, RFMs reduce to noisy linear models and offer no advantage over classical linear methods such as ridge regression. Yet RFMs frequently outperform linear baselines on structured real data. We show that this tension is explained by a correlation-driven phase transition: under spiked-covariance designs, the interaction between anisotropy and input-label correlation determines whether the RFM behaves as an effectively linear predictor or exhibits genuinely nonlinear gains. Concretely, we establish a universality principle under anisotropy and characterize the RFM generalization error via an equivalent noisy polynomial model. The effective degree of this polynomial, equivalently, which Hermite orders of the activation survive, is governed by the strength of input-label correlation, yielding an explicit boundary in the correlation-spike-magnitude plane. Below the boundary, the RFM collapses to a linear surrogate and can underperform strong linear baselines; above it, higher-order terms persist and the RFM achieves a clear nonlinear advantage. Numerical simulations and real-data experiments corroborate the theory and delineate the transition between these two regimes."}

These embodied agents should be able to learn about and accomplish a wide range of user goals and preferences efficiently and robustly. Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used as they allow for opportunities for rich and open-ended dialog type interaction between the human and agent to accomplish tasks according to human preferences. In this thesis, we argue that for embodied agents that deal with open-ended dialog during task assistance: 1) AI Agents should extract goals from conversations in the form of Natural Language (NL) to be better at capturing human preferences as it is intuitive for humans to communicate their preferences on tasks to agents through natural language. 2) AI Agents should quantify/maintain uncertainty about these goals to ensure that actions are being taken according to goals that the agent is extremely certain about. We present an online method for embodied agents to learn and accomplish diverse user goals. While offline methods like RLHF can represent various goals but require large datasets, our approach achieves similar flexibility with online efficiency. We extract natural language goal representations from conversations with Large Language Models (LLMs). We prompt an LLM to role play as a human with different goals and use the corresponding likelihoods to run Bayesian inference over potential goals. As a result, our method can represent uncertainty over complex goals based on unrestricted dialog. We evaluate in a text-based grocery shopping domain and an AI2Thor robot simulation. We compare our method to ablation baselines that lack either explicit goal representation or probabilistic inference."}

These properties depend on both the dimension of covariates and the signal strength. In the case of Gaussian covariates and a well-specified logistic model, we obtain sharp non-asymptotic guarantees for the existence and excess logistic risk of the MLE.

Many recent research works have attempted to provide a reduction from the $O(n^2)$ time complexity of attention to semi-linear complexity. However, it remains an unsolved problem in the sense of maintaining high performance when complexity is reduced. One of the important works in this respect is the Perceiver class of architectures that have demonstrated excellent performance, while reducing the computation complexity. In this paper, we use the PerceiverAR as a basis and explore the design space of different trade-offs between preserving context and reducing attention complexity. To this end, we develop four new architectural paradigms, the best performing of which we denote as the Efficient Context propagating Perceiver (ECP). ECP has two major advantages over the PerceiverAR. First, the ECP architecture overcomes the main drawback of PercieverAR by utilizing both the context and the latent sequences in autoregressive training. Second, the ECP architecture operates with the same attention complexity as LongLoRA, making it computationally efficient. More importantly, via pairwise segment attention, it extracts better information resulting in improved language modeling. Empirically, we demonstrate that the ECP architecture significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art Transformer models on Wikitext-103, PG-19 and sCIFAR-10."}

We argue that this is unlikely to be a good design choice in contexts with high potential for disagreement, like in the training of large language models. We formalise and analyse the problem of learning a reward model that can be specialised to a user. Using the principle of empirical risk minimisation, we derive a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound showing the dependency of the approximation error on the number of training examples, as usual, and also on the number of human raters who provided feedback on them. Based on our theoretical findings, we discuss how to best collect pairwise preference data and argue that adaptive reward models should be beneficial when there is considerable disagreement among users. We also propose a concrete architecture for an adaptive reward model. Our approach leverages the observation that individual preferences can be captured as a linear combination of a set of general reward features. We show how to learn such features and subsequently use them to quickly adapt the reward model to a specific individual, even if their preferences are not reflected in the training data. We present experiments with large language models illustrating our theoretical results and comparing the proposed architecture with a non-adaptive baseline.

The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary. However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available atthis https URL."}

Neural networks do not make generically unbiased predictions, and biases will propagate to estimators that use their predictions. While structured variables extracted from unstructured data have traditionally been treated as proxies - implicitly accepting arbitrary measurement error - this poses various challenges in an era where constantly evolving AI can cheaply extract data. Researcher degrees of freedom (e.g., the choice of neural network architecture, training data or prompts, and numerous implementation details) raise concerns about p-hacking and how to best show robustness, the frequent deprecation of proprietary neural networks complicates reproducibility, and researchers need a principled way to determine how accurate predictions need to be before making costly investments to improve them. To address these challenges, this study develops MAR-S (Missing At Random Structured Data), a semiparametric missing data framework that enables unbiased, efficient, and robust inference with unstructured data, by correcting for neural network prediction error with a validation sample. MAR-S synthesizes and extends existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions and connects them to familiar problems such as causal inference, highlighting valuable parallels.

We then evaluated three distinct approaches to automated scoring: zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and supervised fine-tuning, implemented across three large language models (GPT-5, Llama 3.1 8B, and ModernBERT). Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B achieved the best results and demonstrated particular strength on subskills with highly separable proficiency levels with balanced labels across levels, while lower performance was observed for subskills that required detection of subtle distinctions between proficiency levels or imbalanced labels. Our exploratory work represents an initial step toward scalable assessment of critical thinking skills across authentic educational contexts. Future research should continue to combine automated critical thinking assessment with human validation to more accurately detect and measure dynamic, higher-order thinking skills."}

However, while current WFMs process only one modality, depending on the task and operating conditions, the most informative modality changes and no single modality is best for all tasks. WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities. We believe this provides a concrete step toward both AI-native 6G and the vision of joint sensing, communication, and localization."}

However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel \"free-lunch\" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings."}

Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent runtime. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis."}

Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning."}

Our approach introduces uncertainty-aware regularization directly in the representation space, encouraging representations that are not only predictive but also stable, well-calibrated, and robust to noise and structural perturbations. Structural constraints, such as sparsity, relational structure, or feature-group dependencies, are incorporated to define meaningful geometry and reduce spurious variability in learned representations, without assuming fully correct or noise-free structure. Importantly, the proposed framework is independent of specific model architectures and can be integrated with a wide range of representation learning methods."}

In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs' initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses.

Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration--Exploitation Distillation (E$^2$D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E$^2$D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being $18\\times$ faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining $4.3\\times$ faster.

This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training.

Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves global optima of empirical risk by jointly controlling the extreme eigenvalues of a structure matrix and the gradient energy, and we establish a corresponding convergence theorem. We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks.

These findings suggest that even in mixed communities, plugin ecosystems can develop recognizable engineering structures, motivating future work that highlight three different research directions with six research questions related to the health and sustainability of these non-developer ecosystems."}

However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.To address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale."}

But foundations differ in their policies, funding models, and support strategies. Moreover, since projects joining these foundations are diverse, coming at different lifecycle stages and having different needs, it can be challenging to decide on the appropriate project-foundation match and on the project-specific plan for sustainability.Here, we present an empirical study and quantitative analysis of the sustainability of incubator projects in the Apache, Eclipse, and OSGeo foundations, and, additionally, of OSS projects from GitHub outside of foundations. We develop foundation-specific sustainability models and a project triage, based on projects' sociotechnical trace profiles, and demonstrate their effectiveness across the foundations. Our results show that our models with triage can effectively forecast sustainability outcomes not only within but across foundations. In addition, the generalizability of the framework allows us to apply the approach to GitHub projects outside the foundations. We complement our findings with actionable recovery strategies from previous work and apply them to case studies of failed incubator projects.

This cycle is accelerating, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as web development and deep learning.

To address this, this study proposes a new automated method called ``Mutual Impact Analysis of OSS (MIAO)'' to quantify these competitive relationships. The proposed method employs a structural vector autoregressive model and impulse response functions, normally used in macroeconomic analysis, to analyze the interactions among OSS projects. In an empirical analysis involving mining and analyzing 187 OSS project groups, MIAO identified projects that were forced to cease development owing to competitive influences with up to 81\\% accuracy, and the resulting features supported predictive experiments that anticipate cessation one year ahead with up to 77\\% accuracy.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) has been an essential part of the web since the beginning, as it allows defining webpages in a tree-like manner, including semantics and content. Although the web was never meant to be an application platform, it evolved as such, especially since the early 2000s, as web application frameworks became available. While the emergence of frameworks made it easier than ever to develop complex applications, it also put HTML on the back burner. As web standards caught up, especially with milestones such as HTML5, the gap between the web platform and frameworks was reduced. HTML First development emphasizes this shift and puts focus on literally using HTML first when possible, while encouraging minimalism familiar from the early days of the web. It seems HTML-oriented web development can provide clear benefits to developers, especially when it is combined with comple- mentary approaches, such as embracing hypermedia and moving a large part of application logic to the server side. In the context of the htmx project, it was observed that moving towards HTML can reduce the size of a codebase greatly while leading to maintenance and development benefits due to the increased conceptual simplicity. Holotype-based comparisons for content-oriented websites show performance benefits, and the same observation was confirmed by a small case study where the Yle website was converted to follow HTML First principles. In short, the HTML First approach seems to have clear advantages for web developers, while there are open questions related to the magnitude of the benefits and the alignment with the recent trend of AI-driven web development."}

Disjunction composition allows for modeling and testing the integrated behavior while ensuring that the testing power of the original set of scenarios is preserved. This is proved using a symbolic semantics for BDD transition systems, with the property that the symbolic equivalence of two BDD transition systems guarantees that they fail the same test cases.

With major corporations and academic institutions investing in quantum hardware and software, there has been a rise in the development of quantum-enabled systems, particularly within open-source communities. However, despite the promising nature of quantum technologies, these communities face critical socio-technical challenges, including the emergence of socio-technical anti-patterns known as community smells. These anti-patterns, prevalent in open-source environments, have the potential to negatively impact both product quality and community health by introducing technical debt and amplifying architectural and code smells. Despite the importance of these socio-technical factors, there remains a scarcity of research investigating their influence within quantum open-source communities. This work aims to address this gap by providing a first step in analyzing the socio-technical well-being of quantum communities through a cross-sectional study.

We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution. Across a range of Office tasks, world-model-guided test-time scaling improves decision quality and execution robustness."}

Current approaches typically encode ethics as fixed, rule-based constraints or as a single chosen ethical theory embedded at design time. This overlooks a fundamental property of human-system interaction settings: ethical preferences vary across individuals and groups, evolve with context, and may conflict, while still needing to remain within a legally and regulatorily defined hard-ethics envelope (e.g., safety and compliance constraints). This paper advocates a shift from static ethical rules to runtime ethical reasoning for self-adaptive systems, where ethical preferences are treated as runtime requirements that must be elicited, represented, and continuously revised as stakeholders and situations change. We argue that satisfying such requirements demands explicit ethics-based negotiation to manage ethical trade-offs among multiple humans who interact with, are represented by, or are affected by a system. We identify key challenges, ethical uncertainty, conflicts among ethical values (including human, societal, and environmental drivers), and multi-dimensional/multi-party/multi-driver negotiation, and outline research directions and questions toward ethically self-adaptive systems."}

We outline a research roadmap towards a software reference architecture (SRA) to realize this vision, elaborated following a standard methodological framework for SRA development. As an initial step, we conducted a stakeholder-driven focus group session to elicit generic system requirements for NLP4RE tools. This activity resulted in 36 key system requirements, further motivating the need for a dedicated SRA.

OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits.

Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation."}

We analyze 28 LLM-based penetration testing systems and evaluate five representative implementations across three benchmarks of increasing complexity. Our analysis reveals two distinct failure modes: Type A failures stem from capability gaps (missing tools, inadequate prompts) that engineering readily addresses, while Type B failures persist regardless of tooling due to planning and state management limitations. We show that Type B failures share a root cause that is largely invariant to the underlying LLM: agents lack real-time task difficulty estimation. As a result, agents misallocate effort, over-commit to low-value branches, and exhaust context before completing attack chains.Based on this insight, we present Excalibur, a penetration testing agent that couples strong tooling with difficulty-aware planning. A Tool and Skill Layer eliminates Type A failures through typed interfaces and retrieval-augmented knowledge. A Task Difficulty Assessment (TDA) mechanism addresses Type B failures by estimating tractability through four measurable dimensions (horizon estimation, evidence confidence, context load, and historical success) and uses these estimates to guide exploration-exploitation decisions within an Evidence-Guided Attack Tree Search (EGATS) framework. Excalibur achieves up to 91% task completion on CTF benchmarks with frontier models (39 to 49% relative improvement over baselines) and compromises 4 of 5 hosts on the GOAD Active Directory environment versus 2 by prior systems.

Additionally, the impact of prompt styles on LLM performance for SE tasks within a historical context remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose HAFix, which stands for History-Augmented LLMs on Bug Fixing, a novel approach that leverages seven individual historical heuristics associated with bugs and aggregates the results of these heuristics (HAFix-Agg) to enhance LLMs' bug-fixing capabilities. To empirically evaluate HAFix, we employ three Code LLMs (i.e., Code Llama, DeepSeek-Coder and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite models) on 51 single-line Python bugs from BugsInPy and 116 single-line Java bugs from Defects4J. Our evaluation demonstrates that multiple HAFix heuristics achieve statistically significant improvements compared to a non-historical baseline inspired by GitHub Copilot. Furthermore, the aggregated HAFix variant HAFix-Agg achieves substantial improvements by combining the complementary strengths of individual heuristics, increasing bug-fixing rates by an average of 45.05% on BugsInPy and 49.92% on Defects4J relative to the corresponding baseline. Moreover, within the context of historical heuristics, we identify the Instruction prompt style as the most effective template compared to the InstructionLabel and InstructionMask for LLMs in bug fixing. Finally, we evaluate the cost of HAFix in terms of inference time and token usage, and provide a pragmatic trade-off analysis of the cost and bug-fixing performance, offering valuable insights for the practical deployment of our approach in real-world scenarios."}

With polynomial scalability, ATLAS provides a robust infrastructure for generating the information-dense datasets required by next-generation, graph-aware ML4SE models.Video demonstration:this https URLTool github repository:this https URL"}

We present CaveAgent, a framework that shifts tool use from ``LLM-as-Text-Generator'' to ``LLM-as-Runtime-Operator.'' CaveAgent introduces a dual-stream architecture that inverts the conventional paradigm: rather than treating the LLM's text context as the primary workspace with tools as auxiliary, CaveAgent elevates the persistent Python runtime as the central locus of state, with a lightweight semantic stream serving as its orchestrator. Beyond leveraging code generation to resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, CaveAgent introduces \\textit{Stateful Runtime Management}: it injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns, unlike existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound. CaveAgent further provides a runtime-integrated skill management system that extends the Agent Skills open standard, enabling ecosystem interoperability through executable skill injections. This persistence mechanism serves as a high-fidelity external memory that reduces context drift in multi-turn interactions and preserves processed data for downstream applications without information loss. Evaluations show consistent improvement across challenging benchmarks, enabling CaveAgent to handle data scales that cause context overflow in both JSON-based and code-based agents. The accessible runtime state further provides programmatically verifiable feedback, enabling automated evaluation and reward signal generation without human annotation and establishing a structural foundation for future research in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)."}

However, there is no systematic study on their effectiveness in autonomously reproducing Linux kernel vulnerabilities with concrete proofs-of-concept (PoCs). Owing to the size, complexity, and low-level nature of the Linux kernel, such tasks are widely regarded as particularly challenging for current LLM-based approaches.In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of LLM-based Linux kernel vulnerability reproduction. For this purpose, we develop K-Repro, an LLM-based agentic system equipped with controlled code-browsing, virtual machine management, interaction, and debugging capabilities. Using kernel security patches as input, K-Repro automates end-to-end bug reproduction of N-day vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. On a dataset of 100 real-world exploitable Linux kernel vulnerabilities collected from KernelCTF, our results show that K-Repro can generate PoCs that reproduce over 50\\% of the cases with practical time and monetary cost.Beyond aggregate success rates, we perform an extensive study of effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and impact factors to explain when agentic reproduction succeeds, where it fails, and which components drive performance. These findings provide actionable guidance for building more reliable autonomous security agents and for assessing real-world N-day risk from both offensive and defensive perspectives."}
